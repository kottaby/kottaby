/**
 * Safety gate for the restore-verify tool.
 *
 * The restore DESTROYS and recreates public objects in the target database
 * (`pg_restore --clean --if-exists`), so the exact connection string handed
 * to pg_restore must pass the repo's destructive-database guard, and the
 * operator must have confirmed the run with `--yes-i-understand`.
 *
 * Target normalization (this module ONLY — the shared guard lib is never
 * modified): the destructive-db guard analyzes host signals from a
 * `postgresql://` URL, but operators may pass PostgreSQL keyword/value
 * conninfo strings (`host=x.rds.amazonaws.com dbname=y`). Before assessment
 * the target is normalized:
 *
 *   - a `postgresql://`/`postgres://` URL is assessed via its LIBPQ-EFFECTIVE
 *     host: libpq percent-decodes the host component of a connection URI,
 *     while WHATWG URL parsers do NOT decode the host of non-special schemes
 *     — so `postgresql://prod.rds.amazonaws.co%6d/db` parses with the ENCODED
 *     host and would slip past marker analysis while libpq connects to the
 *     decoded managed host. Each `.`-separated host label carrying a `%` is
 *     therefore percent-decoded (a malformed escape is UNASSESSABLE and
 *     refuses the run) and ALL trailing dots are stripped (`prod.rds…com.`
 *     is DNS-equal to `prod.rds…com` but invisible to suffix markers); the
 *     guard assesses the decoded, dot-stripped host;
 *   - a key=value conninfo string has its `host`/`hostaddr`/`dbname`
 *     keywords extracted with libpq LAST-OCCURRENCE semantics (libpq applies
 *     repeated keywords in order, so `host=a host=b` connects to `b`) and
 *     synthesized into `postgresql://<host>/<db>` URL(s) for the guard's
 *     HOST-SIGNAL analysis only; every synthesized URL is round-tripped
 *     through `new URL()` — a value that cannot form a valid URL (malformed
 *     host characters) refuses the run, because the downstream guard silently
 *     SKIPS its host analysis on unparseable URLs. Trailing dots are stripped
 *     from conninfo host values too, for the same suffix-marker reason;
 *   - a conninfo `hostaddr` must name a LOOPBACK address (127.0.0.0/8, ::1):
 *     hostaddr is the endpoint libpq actually CONNECTS to (host is
 *     verification-only), so a remote numeric endpoint has no assessable
 *     host signal and refuses the run — the same rule the URI query
 *     `hostaddr` channel enforces; a conninfo with `hostaddr` but NO `host`
 *     is refused outright — a bare-IP target with no assessable host signal
 *     cannot be reasoned about (URL-form DSNs with IP hosts remain the
 *     supported drill path);
 *   - a `service=` parameter — in a URI query or as a conninfo keyword — is
 *     libpq SERVICE INDIRECTION: the named service file (forwarded to the
 *     restore children via PGSERVICEFILE) decides the endpoint, so any
 *     target naming a service is unassessable and refuses the run;
 *   - the RAW AUTHORITY SPAN of a URI-form target (after `//`, up to the
 *     first `/` of the raw string — or, on a pathless URI, up to the first
 *     `?`, which is there the query delimiter both libpq and WHATWG agree
 *     on) must be clean: on a pathed URI libpq scans the authority to that
 *     first `/` and splits userinfo at the last `@` inside the span, while
 *     the WHATWG parser ends the authority at the first `?`/`#` —
 *     `postgresql://postgres:?@prod.example.com/db` parses with host
 *     `postgres` under WHATWG but libpq connects to `prod.example.com`. A
 *     raw `?`/`#`/control character in the span, or a userinfo that
 *     percent-decodes into an `@`/`/` (libpq decodes userinfo before use),
 *     is unassessable and refuses the run before any URL parsing (fail
 *     closed: no RFC-legal URL puts raw `?`/`#` in the authority); a
 *     pathless query (`postgresql://localhost:5432?sslmode=disable`) is the
 *     one agreed form and flows to the normal query-channel assessment;
 *   - when `hostaddr` is present alongside `host`, BOTH values are assessed
 *     (libpq connects to `hostaddr` while using `host` for verification), so
 *     token order can never hide one of the two host signals;
 *   - a `postgresql://`/`postgres://` URL's QUERY STRING is a second host
 *     channel: libpq applies `?host=`/`?hostaddr=` query parameters ON TOP of
 *     the authority (overriding the connection target), so the guard parses
 *     the RAW query string, percent-decodes names and values the way libpq
 *     does (`+` stays literal, a malformed escape refuses, last occurrence
 *     wins) and assesses EVERY channel — the authority hostname, the query
 *     `host`, and the query `hostaddr` — through the SAME pipeline (charset
 *     gate, trailing-dot strip, percent-decode re-assessment, `new URL()`
 *     round-trip, managed-marker matching). An EMPTY query `host` (libpq
 *     would fall back to the default socket), a query `hostaddr` naming a
 *     non-loopback address (hostaddr is the endpoint libpq actually connects
 *     to — a remote numeric endpoint has no assessable host signal), or any
 *     other unassessable channel refuses the run; a query host decoding to a
 *     plain local hostname/IP keeps drills working;
 *   - the WHATWG URL parser strips raw tab/newline characters from URLs
 *     while libpq does not, so a URI-form target whose RAW host substring
 *     (or raw query string) carries a raw \t/\n/\r — or whose query carries
 *     a fragment delimiter libpq would fold into a parameter value — refuses
 *     before any URL parsing (fail closed: the assessed URL must be the URL
 *     libpq sees);
 *   - anything else is UNASSESSABLE and refuses the run (fail closed) —
 *     a target whose safety cannot be reasoned about is never restored to.
 *
 * TOCTOU note: the target DSN is parsed ONCE on the CLI, held in a single
 * variable, threaded through this assessment, and later passed UNCHANGED to
 * pg_restore — the assessed string and the executed string are the same
 * object; the synthesized URL exists only inside the guard analysis, and
 * there is no re-parse between gate and spawn.
