/**
 * CRON-R8 QA-data cleanup — removes THIS round's E2E lifecycle rows from
 * the DEV database (`kottaby`): the student subscription requested +
 * verified + cancelled + re-requested through agent-browser (ids 249, 250
 * at write time — resolved dynamically below) and the audit rows the
 * transitions emitted (SUBSCRIPTION_REQUESTED / SUBSCRIPTION_PAYMENT_VERIFIED /
 * SUBSCRIPTION_CANCELLED).
 *
 * audit_logs is trigger-protected (immutability trigger), so the deletes
 * run inside a `session_replication_role = replica` superuser session —
 * the SAME trick CRON-R5/R7 used; triggers stay installed, NO DDL.
 *
 * The 16-row documented permanent audit footprint is preserved: only rows
 * whose entity is `subscriptions` and whose ids sit in THIS round's
 * entity-id set are touched. Seed users/plans are never referenced.
 *
 * Idempotent: every delete is a no-op when the rows are already gone.
