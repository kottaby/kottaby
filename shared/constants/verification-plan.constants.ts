/**
 * Verification plan identity constants — single source of truth for the
 * canonical new-teacher verification product in the plan catalog.
 *
 * `VERIFICATION_PLAN_TITLE` pins the seeded verification plan's identity:
 * purchase resolution looks the plan up server-side from the ACTIVE catalog
 * by exact title match, so this string is the server-side resolution key and
 * must match the seeded row verbatim (the seeder sources it from here, so
 * the two can never drift). `VERIFICATION_PLAN_SESSION_COUNT` is part of the
 * product contract — a verification plan purchase grants exactly five
 * one-on-one evaluation sessions.
 *
 * Shared-layer isolation: this module imports nothing from the backend,
 * frontend, or app layers. It is safe to import from any layer.
