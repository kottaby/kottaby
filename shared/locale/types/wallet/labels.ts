/**
 * Wallet namespace labels — the teacher self-service wallet surface:
 * the balance header, the withdrawal-request dialog, and the
 * transaction ledger.
 *
 * Used by:
 *  - `frontend/views/teacher/wallet/TeacherWalletContainer.tsx`
 *    (`useAppTranslation(Wallet)` with property access).
 *  - Server Components rendering the page via
 *    `await getTranslations(locale)` → property access.
 *
 * All keys MUST have both `en` and `ar` implementations with EXACT key-set
 * parity (compile-typed on both leaves + `wallet-namespace.parity.test.ts`
 * runtime belt). Property access only — never call-by-key.
