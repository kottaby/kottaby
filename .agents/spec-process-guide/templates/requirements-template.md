## Requirements

### Requirement 0: Pre-Implementation Baseline & Execution Protocol

**User Story:** As an AI agent or developer, I want to establish an error baseline before implementation and track outcomes persistently, so that I can distinguish new issues from pre-existing ones and avoid repeating past research.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN feature implementation begins THEN system SHALL record baseline error counts (`bun run scripts/health/sub-loop.ts <file> --lifecycle duplicates` exit code, plus `bun tsgo` / `bun biome:check` / `bun run scripts/lint-service.ts --json --id baseline` for granular per-tool counts) to distinguish new from pre-existing issues.
2. WHEN feature implementation begins THEN system SHALL create deferred-items ledger at `ai/plans/<feature-name>/deferred-items.md` from template to track all deferred work.
3. WHEN an executing agent starts any task THEN system SHALL read ALL existing outcome files in `ai/plans/<feature-name>/outcome/` to absorb prior research, search results, and pitfalls.
4. WHEN an executing agent completes any task THEN system SHALL write a new outcome document under `ai/plans/<feature-name>/outcome/<task-id>-outcome.md` detailing research findings, docs/web search results, implementation details, cross-file dependencies, and carry-over points.
5. WHEN an executing agent completes any subtask THEN system SHALL update the corresponding task checkbox `[ ]` -> `[x]` in `trackable-tasks.md`.
6. WHEN any file is modified THEN system SHALL execute per-file verification via the unified script `bun run scripts/health/sub-loop.ts <file> --lifecycle duplicates` (runs tsgo → oxlint → biome → lint:type-aware → check:duplicates --file; auto-discovers applicable AGENTS.md + .agents/instructions; exit code 0 = pass) on that specific file.
7. WHEN any subtask is marked complete THEN system SHALL complete semantic review checklist (race conditions, env-config, deferred items, cross-layer, enums) before marking `[x]`. The `sub-loop.ts` script handles mechanical checks but cannot detect semantic bugs — this checklist covers what the script cannot.

### Requirement 0.5: Translation System & Enum Import Compliance

**User Story:** As a developer implementing user-facing features, I want compile-time type-safe translations and correct enum imports, so that I catch i18n and type errors at build time instead of runtime.

#### Acceptance Criteria (Translation System)

1. WHEN client component renders user-facing text THEN system SHALL use `useAppTranslation(Translation.<Namespace>)` with Translation enum (not string literal).
2. WHEN translation object is accessed THEN system SHALL use property access (`t.propertyName`) NOT function calls (`t('propertyName')`).
3. WHEN server component renders user-facing text THEN system SHALL use `await getTranslations(locale)` (single arg) and access namespace as property: `t.Dashboard.FeatureName`.
4. WHEN GraphQL resolver returns user-facing text THEN system SHALL use `ctx.t("namespace")` with string key (already bound to `ctx.locale`).
5. WHEN namespace directory is created THEN system SHALL use lowercase casing (`shared/locale/namespaces/ui/featureName.namespace.ts` NOT `Ui/FeatureName/`).

#### Translation System Anti-Patterns (FORBIDDEN)

- ❌ `useAppTranslation("DashboardFeature")` — string literal
- ❌ `getTranslations(locale, "namespace")` — two args
- ❌ `t('propertyName')` — function call
- ❌ Hardcoded strings in UI components
- ❌ `next-intl` imports (legacy, removed)
- ❌ `getBackendTranslations` (legacy, removed)
- ❌ `shared/messages/` references (directory removed)

#### Acceptance Criteria (Enum Imports)

6. WHEN enum is used in runtime expression THEN system SHALL import as value (not `import type`).
7. WHEN enum is used in conditional/cast/object literal THEN system SHALL import as value.
8. WHEN enum consumer exists THEN system SHALL use enum members NOT string literals.

## UX/Navigation Requirements (MANDATORY)

Every feature MUST define its navigation, sidebar, tabs, and permissions for ALL user types.

### New Routes & Role-Based Access

| Route | Purpose | Permission | Roles with Access |
|-------|---------|------------|-------------------|
| `/feature` | List view | `FEATURE_VIEW` | SUPER_ADMIN, ACADEMY_ADMIN, STAFF |
| `/feature/new` | Create form | `FEATURE_MANAGE` | SUPER_ADMIN, ACADEMY_ADMIN |
| `/feature/[id]` | Detail view | `FEATURE_VIEW` | SUPER_ADMIN, ACADEMY_ADMIN, STAFF |

### Sidebar Navigation Placement
Feature pages appear as **sub-items under [Parent Group]** in the **[Group Name] (grp_xxx)** group.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements
- WHEN [load condition] THEN [system name] SHALL [performance criteria]
- IF [usage scenario] THEN [system name] SHALL [response time requirement]

### Security Requirements

- IF [authentication condition] THEN [system name] SHALL [access control behavior]

### Usability Requirements
- WHEN [user interaction] THEN [system name] SHALL [usability standard]
- IF [accessibility condition] THEN [system name] SHALL [accessibility compliance]

### Reliability Requirements

## Tips for Writing Good Requirements

### Do's
- ✅ Use active voice and specific language
- ✅ Focus on what the system should do, not how
- ✅ Make each requirement testable and verifiable
- ✅ Include both positive and negative scenarios
- ✅ Consider edge cases and error conditions

### Don'ts
- ❌ Don't use vague terms like "user-friendly" or "fast"
- ❌ Don't combine multiple requirements in one statement
- ❌ Don't specify implementation details
- ❌ Don't use subjective or unmeasurable criteria
- ❌ Don't forget to consider non-functional aspects

### Common EARS Patterns

**Event-Driven (WHEN)**
- User actions: "WHEN user clicks submit button"
- System events: "WHEN data sync completes"
- Time-based: "WHEN daily backup runs"

**Condition-Based (IF)**
- State checks: "IF user is authenticated"
- Data validation: "IF input is invalid"
- Permission checks: "IF user has admin role"

**Continuous (WHILE)**
- Ongoing processes: "WHILE file is uploading"
- Monitoring: "WHILE system is running"
- Real-time updates: "WHILE user is typing"

**Contextual (WHERE)**
- Platform-specific: "WHERE application runs on mobile"
- Environment-specific: "WHERE system is in production"
- Location-specific: "WHERE user is in restricted area"
