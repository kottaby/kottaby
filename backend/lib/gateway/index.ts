 * Modules:
 *  - `./version`            — `resolveAppVersion()` for the health payload.
 *  - `./public-operations`  — closed public-operation allowlist.
 *  - `./route-inventory`    — classifying registry for every API route.
 *  - `./transport-guard`    — pure transport guards + canonical body-limit constant.
