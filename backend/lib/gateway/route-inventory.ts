/**
 * Route inventory registry — the SINGLE classifying source for every
 * Next.js API route in the tree.
 *
 * Rules:
 *  - One entry per physical route file anywhere under `app/api/`
 *    (convention: `<segment>/route.ts`); the static completeness assertion
 *    FAILS if any real route file is missing here, so no attack surface can
 *    go unclassified.
 *  - Entries use URL-style paths (`/api/…`) — the same tokens the canonical
 *    doc table prints; file→path mapping lives only in the completeness checker.
 *  - Classifications (closed set):
 *      `gateway`              → GraphQL-over-HTTP engine route; transport-local
 *                                error shapes, NOT the REST envelope (canonical
 *                                exemption row in docs/graphql/error-handling-contract.md §envelopes).
 *      `envelope`             → REST-style route already adopting the
 *                                apiSuccessResponse/apiErrorResponse contract.
 *      `provider-ack-exempt`  → webhook ack surfaces (provider callbacks);
 *                                enveloped replies, with the route-documented
 *                                exemptions registered in
 *                                docs/graphql/error-handling-contract.md.
 *      `deferred`             → exists on disk but envelope adoption is owned by
 *                                a later change.
 *
 * Current ground truth: FIVE routes exist on disk —
 * `app/api/graphql/route.ts` (gateway), `app/api/set-locale/route.ts`
 * (envelope), `app/api/health/route.ts` (envelope from the start — the
 * GET-only LB liveness probe, second sanctioned health surface; no other
 * method is exported so every other verb rides the framework 405),
 * `app/api/cron/sweep-sessions/route.ts` (envelope — externally triggered
 * sweep job with the bearer gate + bare-404 kill switch documented on the
 * route) and `app/api/payments/webhook/route.ts` (provider-ack-exempt —
 * gateway callback surface whose disabled kill switch and inactive paymob
 * branch both answer a bare 404, registered in the exemptions inventory).
 * `/api/webhooks/*` and `/api/logs` remain PHANTOM routes (dropped pre-seeds)
 * and MUST NOT be listed until their files physically exist.
