-- 5-student-payments-provider-transaction.sql
-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Purpose: Give the immutable student_payments ledger an auditable link to the
--          payment provider's own records, WITHOUT weakening the immutability
--          record (INV-PAY2). Two changes, layered onto
--          4-student-payments-status-transition.sql:
--
--            1. A new nullable column `provider_transaction_id varchar(64)`
--               holds the gateway's transaction identifier once a payment is
--               decided. It is NULL for every pending (undecided) payment.
--            2. The `prevent_student_payments_update()` guard is re-armed so
--               that within the EXISTING guarded `pending → paid | failed`
--               transition the provider transaction reference may be written
--               exactly once, and only from NULL to a value. An
--               already-recorded reference can never be overwritten
--               (value → value) or erased (value → NULL), and outside the
--               guarded transition the column is frozen like every other
--               financial/identity column. All other columns stay frozen —
--               the same column freeze as migration 4, widened by this one
--               set-once allowance.
--
-- Mechanics: The BEFORE UPDATE trigger on student_payments
--            (prevent_student_payments_update_trigger) already exists and
--            executes this function; replacing the function re-arms the
--            guard in place, so no trigger DDL is needed here. On a fresh
--            database 3-immutability-triggers.sql seeds the strict
--            block-everything guard, then 4-...-status-transition.sql and
--            this file amend it in alphabetical order, so both fresh and
--            existing databases converge on the same guard.
--
-- Idempotency: ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS + CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION — safe
--              to re-run any number of times. NO CONCURRENTLY (per
--              docs/DATABASE_MIGRATIONS.md — Drizzle's migrator is always
--              transactional).
--
-- Dialect:    PostgreSQL. SQLite parity lives in
--             5-student-payments-provider-transaction-sqlite.sql.
