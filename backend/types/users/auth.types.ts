/**
 * Auth service types — login + me + refreshToken DTOs.
 *
 * Design:
 *  - `AuthSession` is the service return shape for `login` — `user` (with
 *    `passwordHash` stripped) + the JWT pair (`accessToken`,
 *    `refreshToken`) + the opaque `sessionId`. The GraphQL `LoginPayload`
 *    exposes `user` + `accessToken` + `refreshToken` (NOT `sessionId` — the
 *    server controls the cookie; the client doesn't need the correlation id).
 *  - `RefreshResult` is the service return shape for `refreshToken` — the
 *    fresh JWT pair only (no user payload — the client already has the user
 *    in React memory; if it doesn't, it follows up with a `me` query).
 *  - The `accessToken`/`refreshToken` fields here are the raw JWT strings,
 *    not the `jose` payload objects. The route handler sets the
 *    `refreshToken` + `sessionId` as httpOnly cookies; the `accessToken`
 *    is returned in the mutation payload (React memory only).
 *
 * @see `docs/auth/REDIRECT_LOOP_FIX.md` for the token architecture rationale.
