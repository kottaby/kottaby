/**
 * Registration types — public + internal DTOs for user registration.
 *
 * Design:
 *  - `RegistrationSubmitInput` is the **public** contract submitted by the
 *    register form. It structurally omits `id`, governance fields
 *    (`isDeleted`, `suspended`, `isBlocked`, …), balances, and the
 *    server-generated `handshakeCode` so mass-assignment (BOPLA) is impossible
 *    at the type level.
 *  - `RegisterPublicRole` is the role subset reachable from the public
 *    mutation: `student | teacher | parent`. `admin` is intentionally absent
 *    (BFLA defense): admin child rows are only created through the
 *    privileged `RegistrationService.createAdminUser` entry point used by
 *    the admin-onboarding flow.
 *  - `RegistrationReturnType` is the service return shape — `UserSelectType`
 *    with `passwordHash` stripped, so the plaintext hash can never leak to a
 *    resolver or response.
 *  - `AdminRegistrationSubmitInput` is the service-only variant permitting
 *    `role: "admin"`. It MUST NOT be referenced by any Pothos input type.
