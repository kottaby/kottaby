/**
 * SessionAdminGovernanceService — governance flow internals (module
 * extraction, behavior-identical): the shared denial classifiers, the
 * append-only audit contract composer, the cancel-reason normalizer, the
 * idempotent-cancel replay machinery, and the three mutation transaction
 * bodies (`rescheduleSessionInTx`, `cancelSessionInTx`,
 * `reassignTeacherInTx`).
 *
 * Fixed order inside every transaction body (identical to the flow it was
 * extracted from): the pre-write read captures audit metadata and
 * classifies an unknown id, the state-eligibility gate stays the guarded
 * single-statement UPDATE (a zero-row miss is classified by ONE cold probe
 * read that never feeds a write), the certification lock on the reassign
 * path is held across check → write in the SAME transaction, exactly ONE
 * audit row is appended through the composition-only writer, the cancel's
 * hold release rides the ONE shared same-lane refund primitive verbatim
 * (a row with no recorded lane refunds nothing; an unreadable lane fails
 * closed and rolls the mutation back), and the idempotency claim — when
 * the caller supplied a key — is inserted savepoint-bracketed BEFORE any
 * session write, with its session pointer backfilled before the body
 * returns — the replay arm backfills it too, so a spent claim always
 * names the session it resolved against.
 *
 * The public surface stays the `SessionAdminGovernanceService` namespace
 * in `session-admin-governance.ts` (the namespace method owns the boundary
 * validation ordering, the BFLA gate, the captured instant, and the
 * `withTransaction` composition; publish-after-commit is the caller's —
 * the bodies only persist the receipts). Nothing in this module is part
 * of the public API.
