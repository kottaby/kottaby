/**
 * SessionLifecycleService — enforcement module: the canonical
 * session transition matrix plus the shared INV-S7/INV-S8/INV-A2-seam gate
 * functions future surfaces consume instead of re-implementing inline
 * status checks.
 *
 * `SESSION_TRANSITION_MATRIX` is the closed `from → to` vocabulary of the
 * session state machine (INV-S1: `completed` is terminal; INV-S2:
 * `cancelled` is terminal; `disputed` is exited ONLY by admin arbitration
 * into a terminal state — B.18):
 *
 *   scheduled → { started, cancelled, disputed }
 *   started   → { completed, cancelled, disputed }
 *   disputed  → { completed, cancelled }
 *   completed → { }
 *   cancelled → { }
 *
 * The matrix is a PURE module-level constant (no DB, no logging, O(1)
 * lookup, no per-call allocation) and is the single source of truth for
 * legal transitions: the shipped guarded writers keep their inline
 * pre-state predicates (zero risk to shipped write paths — plan Decision
 * 1), while the matrix drives the journey-level regression sweep that
 * pins every edge (`session-state-machine.journey.test.ts`).
 *
 * The gates are the shared enforcement points:
 *  - `assertSessionCompletedForReport` (INV-S7) — reports may only be
 *    submitted for `completed` sessions (the report surface consumes it);
 *  - `assertReportSubmittedForHomework` (INV-S8) — homework may only be
 *    created for sessions whose report exists (the homework surface consumes it);
 *  - `assertTeacherNotInActiveSession` (the availability-toggle seam) —
 *    a teacher in a `started` session cannot be toggled available.
 *
 * Every gate executes on the CALLER's transaction (`tx` propagated, never
 * one of its own), reads only through repository surfaces, takes only
 * server-derived ids (never client payloads — BOPLA), and denies with the
 * localized `ConflictError` shapes of the lifecycle vocabulary (exactly
 * one `logger.logDomainError` per denial site; happy paths silent). The
 * denials are internal-only surfaces: participation/authorization checks
 * belong to the consuming caller BEFORE the gate — the gates widen no
 * existence oracle (a wrong-state row and an unknown id are
 * indistinguishable at this layer by design).
 *
 * Localization: the `t` parameter is OPTIONAL — callers that already hold
 * the request's `errorsTranslations` (the consuming service methods) pass
 * it through; omission falls back to the platform default locale through
 * the compile-time translation system (never a hardcoded string).
 *
 * @see docs/sessions/session-lifecycle.md §10 — the consumer table this
 *      module closes.
 * @see docs/specs/state-machine-invariants.md §1 — INV-S1..S8 vocabulary.
