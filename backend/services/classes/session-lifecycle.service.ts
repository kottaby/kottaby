/**
 * SessionLifecycleService — the booking + lifecycle state machine for the
 * `session` entity (scheduled → started → completed | cancelled, with both
 * live states able to pass through `disputed`: scheduled|started → disputed
 * → cancelled|completed under admin arbitration).
 *
 * Booking (`createSession`) composes FOUR writes inside ONE transaction, in a
 * fixed order that is never reordered:
 *   1. the teacher certification lock (a `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` read whose
 *      certification value is the one the booking commits against);
 *   2. the guarded trial-first balance debit ladder (the trial lane is
 *      attempted first, then the intent's own lane; an all-miss booking
 *      throws and the transaction rolls back — the rollback is the only
 *      cleanup, no compensating writes exist);
 *   3. the idempotency claim insert (savepoint-bracketed so a duplicate key
 *      rolls back only the claim statement and keeps the surrounding
 *      transaction readable for the replay lookup);
 *   4. the session insert with server-side defaults (lifecycle state, type,
 *      intent, platform fee, hold marker + provenance lane, confirmation
 *      deadline) followed by the claim's session-id backfill.
 * A replayed booking (duplicate claim key) THROWS `ConflictError(
 * "DUPLICATE_REQUEST")` — never a row.
 * Throwing is what keeps the replayed attempt free of charge: its own
 * partial writes roll back with the transaction (zero new rows, no second
 * debit); the success-equivalent experience is the client-side mapping of
 * the 409 per the error-handling contract.
 *
 * Every path guards the caller-supplied target session id as a positive
 * safe integer BEFORE any database work: the three mutations deny
 * a malformed id with the canonical `VALIDATION` error, and the participant
 * read degrades one to the oracle-safe `null` — a garbage id can never reach
 * SQL.
 *
 * Transitions (`startSession` / `completeSession` / `cancelSession`) are
 * single guarded repository UPDATEs; a zero-row match is classified by ONE
 * cold probe read that never influences any write. Cancellation refunds the
 * lane that funded the hold inside the same transaction, and keeps the start
 * stamp while never writing an end stamp; the trimmed reason persists inside
 * the guarded UPDATE itself. Disputes (`openSessionDispute`) are the same
 * participant-guarded shape from either live state; the arbitration
 * (`resolveSessionDispute`) is admin-only (defense-in-depth role re-check
 * on top of the GraphQL scope gate) and resolves a disputed row into exactly
 * one terminal state — CANCEL refunds the recorded lane through the SAME
 * same-lane primitive the participant cancel uses (one transaction, no
 * partial application), COMPLETE requires a written start stamp and consumes
 * the hold without any wallet credit. Reads are participant-scoped and
 * oracle-safe: a foreign id is indistinguishable from a nonexistent one
 * (the admin arbitration surface distinguishes state, never participants).
 *
 * Governance re-checks (deleted/blocked/suspended callers) re-assert the
 * login/SSR fail-closed gate at the service boundary as defense in depth.
 * Cancellation is deliberately exempt so a governed participant can still
 * release an in-flight hold later.
 *
 * Cross-surface dependency policy: the module's cross-surface dependencies
 * are the wallet repository — composed into the dual-confirmation flow to
 * credit the teacher's earnings when the student confirms a completed
 * session — and the notification engine's emit/publish contracts for the
 * two student-facing completion waves (the confirm prompt once the
 * teacher's completion stamp lands, and the auto-cancel notice once the
 * confirmation window lapses). Notification rows are written exclusively by
 * the engine inside the owning transaction, and their delivery receipts are
 * published strictly after that transaction commits — never for a
 * rolled-back flow. The module imports nothing from the audit or report
 * surfaces. All user-facing messages resolve through
 * `getServerTranslations(locale)`;
 * rejections log via `logger.logDomainError` with `{code, entity, entityId}`
 * only — never idempotency keys, payloads, or the other participant's data.
 * No module-level mutable state; no swallowed catches; every mutation flow
 * is one transaction with `tx` propagated to every repository call.
 *
 * File layout: the flow internals live in sibling modules extracted
 * verbatim (behavior-identical max-lines refactor) —
 * `session-lifecycle.guards.ts` (pure pre-DB guards/normalizers and the
 * probe-status widenings), `session-lifecycle.governance.ts` (actor/admin
 * governance re-checks), `session-lifecycle.transitions.ts` (the zero-row
 * miss classifier and the same-lane refund primitive),
 * `session-lifecycle.booking.ts` (the booking transaction body),
 * `session-lifecycle.confirmation.ts` (the dual-confirmation transaction
 * body) and `session-lifecycle.queries.ts` (the read/query surface —
 * participant reads and the admin arbitration list — surfaced here through
 * thin same-signature delegates so the public namespace API is unchanged).
 * Every public method below is the same flow in the same order —
 * each owns its boundary validation ordering, governance re-check, and the
 * `withTransaction` composition, delegating only the transaction bodies and
 * shared pre-DB checks to the siblings. The public API (names, signatures,
 * behavior) is unchanged.

   *    stamp and flips `fee_held = false` (the exactly-once guard lives in
   *    the statement's predicate), then — same transaction — the credit
   *    slice composes through the wallet repository: the teacher's wallet
   *    row is ensured (idempotent ON CONFLICT insert; no approval-time
   *    wallet writer exists yet), ONE `earning` ledger row is inserted
   *    with the session's `fee` taken verbatim, and the wallet's
   *    `balance`/`total_earning` increase by exactly that fee (no DB
   *    trigger exists — the increment is explicit, atomic with the ledger
   *    row).
   *  - Already-confirmed student, an already-released hold (admin
   *    arbitration consumed it first), or the TEACHER caller (whose stamp
   *    `completeSessionOnce` already wrote): the current row is returned
   *    untouched — ZERO financial writes, the honest idempotent answer.
   *  - A zero-row guarded miss on a live-state row is classified by one
   *    cold probe read (unknown/non-participant → not-found, oracle-safe;
   *    anything else → transition conflict), so a foreign caller can never
   *    distinguish a missing row from one they do not own.
   *
   * @param callerUserId  The acting participant's id (the session's student
   *     or its teacher).
