/**
 * RecitationRecordService — the write-once recitation record of a session
 * and its participant-scoped read.
 *
 * The `recitation` row is the 1:1 companion of a `session`: the owning
 * `session_id` is NOT NULL, cascades on session deletion, and is UNIQUE —
 * one record per session, enforced by the database itself. This service is
 * the single write/read seam over that contract:
 *
 *  - `setSessionRecitation` records the recitation of a HAPPENED session
 *    as its owning teacher. The pipeline order is the contract: pre-DB
 *    shape guards (target id + submission payload) fail before any
 *    database read; the actor's governance state is re-asserted before
 *    the transaction opens (defense in depth for still-valid tokens);
 *    then ONE transaction resolves the session by id, collapses a miss
 *    or a non-owner onto the identical session-not-found denial (a
 *    foreign id is byte-indistinguishable from one that never was), and
 *    rejects a session that never happened (`scheduled`/`cancelled`).
 *    The insert is the pipeline's only write; the per-session unique
 *    constraint is the arbiter of the write-once rule — a duplicate
 *    surfaces as the typed conflict, and the stored record is never
 *    updated or replaced (no such surface exists).
 *  - `getSessionRecitation` is the oracle-safe read: a malformed id, an
 *    unknown session, and a non-participant caller all collapse to the
 *    same `null`, and a participant receives the row when it exists and
 *    `null` when the session is not yet recorded. No read path raises.
 *
 * Cross-surface purity: the service writes to the `recitation` table
 * ONLY — zero notification, audit, wallet, ledger, or session-row writes
 * (the session lifecycle owns the session row exclusively), and it never
 * imports the notification or audit surfaces.
 *
 * All user-facing messages resolve through `getServerTranslations(locale)`;
 * every denial logs exactly ONE bounded `logger.logDomainError` entry
 * (code, entity, entity id, locale — never the submitted payload, never a
 * counterparty value), while happy paths and collapse-to-null reads log
 * nothing. No module-level mutable state; every repository call inside the
 * write flow receives the SAME transaction.
