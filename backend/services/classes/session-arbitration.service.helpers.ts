/**
 * SessionArbitrationService — flow internals (module extraction, the
 * sibling-helpers layout of the session services): the consumed-escrow
 * dispute path's pre-DB guards, denial classifiers, financial-leg
 * composition, and the arbitration audit contract.
 *
 * The dispute generations are discriminated by the row's persisted hold
 * marker (`fee_held`): a held dispute resolves through the shipped
 * held-family service (Cancel | Complete), a consumed dispute — the fee
 * already credited to the teacher's wallet by the dual confirmation —
 * resolves HERE through the three-outcome vocabulary (Refund |
 * PartialRefund | Uphold). Every classifier below is a typed denial that
 * logs exactly one bounded domain error; the not-found / state-conflict
 * pair is shared verbatim with the governance surface's classifiers so
 * every session surface emits the same two denial shapes.
 *
 * Financial legs:
 *  - the teacher reversal is the compensating ledger row: one `withdrawal`
 *    ledger row keyed to the session, plus the guarded balance decrement,
 *    on the caller's transaction — a `null` from the guarded debit means
 *    insufficient funds, which fails the whole arbitration (zero financial
 *    writes survive);
 *  - the student compensation is the quantized session-credit ruling: ONE
 *    credit to the row's recorded provenance lane for BOTH refund
 *    outcomes, never a fractional lane write; a row with no recorded lane
 *    refunds nothing (the never-held defensive case), an unreadable lane
 *    fails closed;
 *  - the partial amount is a strict decimal string: two fractions at
 *    most, strictly positive, strictly below the session fee — validated
 *    before the first write, and the exact supplied string is what the
 *    debit and the audit row carry (never re-parsed, never re-rounded).
 *
 * Nothing in this module is part of the public API.
