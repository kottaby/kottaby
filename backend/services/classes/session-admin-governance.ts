/**
 * SessionAdminGovernanceService — the admin-only governance surface over
 * the `session` entity: the directory read pair (filterable list with the
 * derived attention badge, plus the any-state browse detail) and the four
 * operator mutations (reschedule the timing pair, cancel with the
 * same-lane hold release, reassign the teacher, and join a live session as
 * a read-only observer).
 *
 * Every method opens with the defense-in-depth BFLA gate
 * (`assertActorAdmin`) — the GraphQL scope gate is the first wall, this
 * service-side re-assertion is the second; both denials perform ZERO reads
 * past the gate and ZERO writes. Every user-facing message resolves
 * through `getServerTranslations(locale)`; rejections log via
 * `logger.logDomainError` with `{code, entity, entityId}` only.
 *
 * Mutation discipline (mirrors the session lifecycle's own flows):
 *  - each mutation wraps its writes in ONE `withTransaction(outerTx, …)`
 *    and hands that SAME `tx` to every repository, audit, refund, and
 *    notification call — partial application is impossible;
 *  - state eligibility is enforced by the guarded single-statement
 *    UPDATEs (the eligibility clause IS the atomic gate); a zero-row miss
 *    is classified by ONE cold probe read that never feeds a write
 *    (unknown id → localized not-found; anything else → the localized
 *    state conflict);
 *  - exactly ONE audit row is appended per committed mutation, inside the
 *    same transaction, through the composition-only audit writer; denial
 *    paths append ZERO audit rows;
 *  - the cancel's hold release composes the ONE shared same-lane refund
 *    primitive verbatim (a row with no recorded lane refunds nothing;
 *    an unreadable lane fails closed and rolls the mutation back);
 *  - the cancel is idempotent through the same claim-table mechanism the
 *    booking flow uses: the claim is inserted savepoint-bracketed inside
 *    the mutation transaction, a duplicate key (PG 23505) resolves the
 *    replay, and a replayed cancel returns the already-cancelled row with
 *    zero new writes — no duplicate audit row, no second refund;
 *  - notification waves persist inside the mutation transaction as
 *    unpublished delivery receipts and are published strictly AFTER the
 *    caller's own commit (publish-after-commit — nothing is ever pushed
 *    for a rolled-back emit; on the caller-transaction test path the
 *    publish step is skipped because the caller owns the commit).
 *
 * File layout: the flow internals live in a sibling module extracted
 * verbatim (behavior-identical max-lines refactor) —
 * `session-admin-governance.helpers.ts` holds the shared denial
 * classifiers, the audit contract composer, the cancel-reason normalizer,
 * the idempotent-cancel replay machinery, and the three mutation
 * transaction bodies. Every public method below is the same flow in the
 * same order — each owns its boundary validation ordering, the BFLA gate,
 * and the `withTransaction` composition, delegating only the transaction
 * bodies and shared pre-DB checks to the sibling. The public API (names,
 * signatures, behavior) is unchanged.
 *
 * No module-level mutable state; no swallowed catches; no hardcoded
 * strings.
