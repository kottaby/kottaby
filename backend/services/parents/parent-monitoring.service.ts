/**
 * ParentMonitoringService — business-logic hub for the parent's read-only
 * monitoring portal.
 *
 * Seven user-facing read operations back the parent dashboard's monitoring
 * surfaces. Every operation is a READ — zero writes of any kind, zero
 * mutations, zero notifications. The service is the authorization spine
 * for the portal: every per-student read funnels through ONE gate
 * (`requireLinkedChild`) run inside the SAME transaction as the data
 * reads, so the link grant and the row scan share one repeatable read
 * snapshot — a severance that lands mid-flight cannot extend a returned
 * payload (the TOCTOU seal).
 *
 *  - `listLinkedChildren` — the caller's confirmed-linked children,
 *    soft-deleted children excluded. The only identity in the predicate
 *    is the verified `parentActorId` (no per-student gate needed — the
 *    parent reads their own list).
 *  - `getChildProgress` — the gated child header echo plus the honest
 *    progress row count and the latest Jadid/Madi positions, in ONE
 *    payload (the detail header and the progress tab are served
 *    together — fewer authorization seams).
 *  - `listChildSessions` — derived attendance entries (session rows),
 *    paged newest-first.
 *  - `listChildReports` — per-session report rows joined to their
 *    session for status/timestamp context, paged newest-session-first.
 *  - `listChildHomework` — homework rows with the two parallel track
 *    blocks (Jadid/Madi), paged newest-session-first.
 *  - `getSessionTarget` — the closed `{ sessionId, studentId }` pair
 *    resolving one completion-notification session pointer onto the
 *    LINKED child who owns it (the deep-link landing read).
 *  - `listChildrenUpcomingSessions` — one glance block per linked child
 *    (child echo + scheduled-session glance window + honest scheduled
 *    total), the parent dashboard's "What's next" card read.
 *
 * Disciplines enforced here:
 *  - Defense-in-depth actor re-check — every method starts with
 *    `requireActor(parentActorId, UserRole.Parent, locale, outerTx,
 *    false)` (the relaxed READ path: identity + role only; a
 *    governed-but-not-deleted parent's self-scoped reads stay visible).
 *    The helper is imported from the same-domain sibling
 *    `./parent-link-request.helpers` — never duplicated.
 *  - Per-student reads open ONE `withTransaction` and run the
 *    `requireLinkedChild` gate FIRST, before any data read, all inside
 *    the same transaction snapshot.
 *  - Constant-shape denial: for the per-student reads, a missing id, a
 *    foreign id, a never-linked id, a severed child, and a malformed id
 *    are byte-indistinguishable to the caller — the link gate throws the
 *    SAME constant `ForbiddenError` with ONE bounded `logDomainError`
 *    (never logging child fields). `getSessionTarget` is the deliberate
 *    exception: a malformed sessionId rejects as a distinguishable
 *    `ValidationError` before any gate or read runs.
 *  - Pagination: `page >= 1`, `pageSize` clamped to [1, 50]; effective
 *    values echoed in every page payload; an out-of-range page yields
 *    empty `items` next to the true `totalCount` — never a fabricated
 *    window.
 *  - Locale threaded through every method for localized error copy.
 *
 * Implementation detail: the module-private machinery (gate, projection
 * mappers, pagination clamp) lives in `./parent-monitoring.helpers`;
 * the public surface is exactly the six-method namespace below.
