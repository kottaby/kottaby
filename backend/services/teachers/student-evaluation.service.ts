/**
 * StudentEvaluationService — the student→teacher session rating and the
 * rater's own rating history.
 *
 * A session can be rated by its student exactly once, and only after the
 * session's completion handshake has finished: the row is `completed` AND
 * both confirmation stamps (`confirmed_by_teacher_at`,
 * `confirmed_by_student_at`) are set. Both properties are read through the
 * session repository's non-locking eligibility probe — post-confirmation
 * state is monotonic, so a plain read is race-free for this decision and no
 * lock is taken (nothing here ever writes the session row: the lifecycle
 * owns it exclusively, and this flow consumes its state read-only).
 *
 *  - `submitTeacherEvaluation` is the write-once submission gate. The
 *    pipeline order is the contract: pre-DB shape guards (target session id
 *    + whole-star rating) fail before any database read; then ONE
 *    transaction resolves the eligibility probe, collapses a miss or a
 *    non-participant student onto the identical session-not-found denial
 *    (a foreign id is byte-indistinguishable from one that never was),
 *    rejects a session whose handshake has not finished, and inserts the
 *    rating; the transaction then re-averages the rated teacher's live
 *    rating family and writes the result — divided back onto the star
 *    scale and formatted to exactly two decimals — into the teacher row's
 *    cached average column. The recompute reads the stored rows (never an
 *    incremental merge), so the cache is a pure function of the family the
 *    transaction sees; a teacher row missing at that write is an internal
 *    invariant break, logged once and raised untranslated. The rater is
 *    ALWAYS the caller-supplied student id — there is
 *    no client-owned identity channel — and the rated subject is the
 *    session row's teacher, never an argument. The per-(session, evaluator)
 *    unique constraint is the write-once arbiter: a duplicate surfaces as
 *    the typed already-submitted conflict, and the stored rating is never
 *    updated or replaced (no such surface exists). The star input (whole
 *    stars 1..5) is converted to the table's 0-100 score scale HERE, so
 *    every producer stores one canonical scale.
 *  - `listMyTeacherEvaluations` is the caller-scoped read: the evaluator
 *    id is the only filter, so the result is exactly the caller's own live
 *    rating history, newest first, with the soft-delete internals, the
 *    free-text notes, and the server-managed update stamp stripped from
 *    the returned shape.
 *
 * Cross-surface purity: the service writes to the `evaluations` table and
 * — inside that SAME transaction — to the rated teacher's row, where ONLY
 * the cached average column moves; zero notification, audit, wallet,
 * ledger, or session-row writes, and it never imports the notification or
 * audit surfaces.
 *
 * All user-facing messages resolve through `getServerTranslations(locale)`;
 * every denial logs exactly ONE bounded `logger.logDomainError` entry
 * (code, entity, entity id, locale — never the submitted payload, never a
 * counterparty value), while happy paths and the read surface log nothing.
 * No module-level mutable state; every repository call inside the write
 * flow receives the SAME transaction.
