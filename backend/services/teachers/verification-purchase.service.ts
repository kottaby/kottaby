/**
 * VerificationPurchaseService — the purchase flow for the teacher
 * verification plan through the provider-agnostic payment-gateway port.
 *
 * The verification plan is resolved SERVER-SIDE: the wire carries no plan
 * selector at all — the purchasable plan is the ACTIVE catalog row whose
 * title equals the shared verification-plan title constant, so purchase,
 * seeding, and UI can never drift apart on the product's identity.
 *
 * `purchase` composes the flow in a fixed order:
 *
 *   1. the pre-DB boundary: the caller id is a positive safe integer, the
 *      acting user's governance state is re-asserted (deleted/blocked/
 *      suspended callers are denied), and the idempotency key must be
 *      present and within the claim column's length — the key is carried
 *      verbatim (never trimmed, never coerced, never logged);
 *   2. the plan resolve from the active catalog (on the caller's
 *      transaction when `outerTx` is supplied, otherwise a bare pool read)
 *      — a missing or inactive plan fails the purchase BEFORE the gateway
 *      call and before any database write;
 *   3. the gateway checkout, OUTSIDE any database transaction — a provider
 *      call is a network boundary and must never hold a transaction open.
 *      The plan row feeding the checkout input (price + currency, carried
 *      verbatim as decimal strings) is read before the gateway call; the
 *      applicant's user id rides the checkout input's generic purchaser
 *      slot;
 *   4. ONE transaction that owns the authoritative validation and every
 *      write: the plan is re-validated as active (the pre-checkout read is
 *      only a gateway-input lookup — a plan deactivated mid-checkout fails
 *      the purchase), the applicant lifecycle guard is re-asserted (a
 *      missing applicants row, an active re-application cooldown, and a
 *      certified applicant each fail the purchase BEFORE any write), the
 *      idempotency claim is inserted savepoint-bracketed, and the pending
 *      subscription + pending payment rows commit atomically with the
 *      claim's subscription backfill.
 *
 * The verification purchaser is an APPLICANT — a user without a `students`
 * row by construction. The payment row is therefore written with a NULL
 * owner (the owner of record is the subscription's generic user id) and
 * the student↔subscription junction insert is deliberately NOT performed.
 * A re-application from `failed` records one verification attempt in the
 * same transaction; the applicant row then flips to `in_evaluation`
 * through the guarded transition, whose zero-row result (the applicant is
 * already in evaluation under a concurrent or repeat purchase) is a
 * silent no-op, never an error.
 *
 * On a duplicate claim key the flow REPLAYS BY THROWING
 * (`ConflictError("DUPLICATE_REQUEST")` — never a row): throwing is what
 * keeps the replayed attempt free of charge, its own partial writes roll
 * back with the transaction. A key spent by a DIFFERENT caller is denied
 * with the oracle-safe payment-not-found error — another user's claim is
 * never surfaced.
 *
 * The purchaser identity comes exclusively from the caller's argument
 * (context-resolved server-side); the amount and currency come
 * exclusively from the plan row. There is no client-controlled purchase
 * input on this surface — the payment amount is carried verbatim from the
 * plan price: never a number, never arithmetic, never client-derived.
