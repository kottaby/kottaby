/**
 * SubscriptionAdmin helpers — audit-contract composition, strict id
 * coercion, write-error translation, and the canonical row mapping for
 * the subscription-admin service (mirroring the plan-catalog helpers
 * split: the service namespace stays focused on orchestration).
 *
 * Runtime only — no types are declared here; every shape lives in
 * `backend/types/billing/subscription-admin.types.ts` and is imported
 * through `@/backend/types`.
 *
 * Disciplines enforced here:
 *  - Audit contract: `details` carries ids, integers, and ISO date
 *    strings only — never contact-PII, never credentials, never free
 *    text. The composed row is persisted by `AuditService.createAuditLog`
 *    inside the caller's transaction so it can never outlive a
 *    rolled-back mutation.
 *  - Id coercion: STRICT numeric parsing (never `Number.parseInt`), so a
 *    malformed id can never silently address an unrelated row.
 *  - Row mapping: the raw `$inferSelect` projection carries pg-enum
 *    string unions; the ReturnType's enum contract is applied through a
 *    total, fail-closed lookup over each closed vocabulary — never a
 *    cast, never a silent degrade.
 *  - Cancel denials: the zero-row guarded flip is disambiguated into the
 *    not-found miss, the idempotent already-cancelled replay conflict, or
 *    the localized active-only deny; the optional free-text reason is
 *    trimmed and bounded BEFORE any write and never enters a log.
