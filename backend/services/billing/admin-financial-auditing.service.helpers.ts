/**
 * AdminFinancialAuditingService — pure pre-DB validators, normalizers, and

 * transaction, or logs — every function is pure (or throws the canonical
 * typed `VALIDATION` denial) and every builder is a closed vocabulary.
 *
 * Members:
 *  - the amount validator (`assertValidAdjustmentAmount`) — the decimal-string
 *    grammar + positivity, fail-closed BEFORE any database work;
 *  - the reason normalizer (`normalizeAdjustmentReason`) — trim + length cap,
 *    whitespace-only and over-limit content reject with the localized denial;
 *  - the description-marker composers (`composeCreditDescription` /
 *    `composeDebitDescription`) — machine-distinguishable ledger vocabulary
 *    that never collides with the shipped payout-request wording;
 *  - the audit-contract builders (`buildWithdrawalSettleAuditContract` /
 *    `buildWalletAdjustmentAuditContract`) — the D-4 vocabulary mapped onto
 *    the single-writer `AuditLogWriteContract` shape; `reasonPresent` is a
 *    BOOLEAN — the raw reason text is NEVER persisted in audit details.
