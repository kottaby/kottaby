 * beyond the subscription-id twin: GraphQL preserves `ID` as a string,
 * and `Number()` lazily coerces non-decimal syntax ("1e0", "0x1", " 1")
 * into a valid integer — silently addressing a DIFFERENT owner than the
 * one named on the wire — so a string is accepted only in canonical
 * decimal form (the resolver-guard module's documented wire-id
 * discipline), while numeric input (direct service callers) must already
 * be a positive safe integer. Any malformed value maps onto the canonical
 * localized VALIDATION denial — never a silent mis-target, never a 500.
