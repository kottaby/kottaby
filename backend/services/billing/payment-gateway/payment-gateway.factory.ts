/**
 * Payment gateway factory — the provider-agnostic seam that resolves the
 * active `PaymentGatewayPort` adapter from configuration.
 *
 * Consumers (purchase service, webhook route) call `getPaymentGateway()`
 * and never construct adapters directly, so swapping the built-in mock for
 * a real gateway is a configuration change with zero domain-code impact.
 *
 * Resolution semantics:
 *  - The adapter is a lazy singleton keyed on the registered
 *    `PAYMENT_GATEWAY_PROVIDER` env key (read through the typed env getter —
 *    never raw `process.env`); missing/empty values resolve to the built-in
 *    `mock` provider.
 *  - A configured provider without an adapter implementation fails CLOSED
 *    with a localized typed error — the purchase flow never silently falls
 *    back to a different provider than the deployment asked for. Lookups are
 *    own-property guarded, so inherited `Object.prototype` members
 *    (`constructor`, `toString`, …) fail closed too instead of resolving to
 *    a stray inherited value.
 *  - `resetPaymentGateway()` drops the resolved adapter AND invalidates the
 *    shared env snapshot, so provider/secret/enabled changes are observable
 *    on the next resolution without a process restart.
