/**
 * Callback channel factory — the single source of truth for how a provider
 * callback reaches this deployment's webhook receiver.
 *
 * Consumers (intention URL composition, dev tooling, workflow tests) call
 * `getCallbackChannel()` and never read tunnel configuration themselves:
 * this module is the ONLY place that consults the ngrok configuration keys,
 * so per-file tunnel heuristics cannot appear anywhere else.
 *
 * Resolution semantics (development defaults to the fully implemented
 * simulation channel — offline and dependency-free):
 *  - A production runtime, or any deployment whose active provider is not
 *    paymob, resolves the `real` channel: the provider posts to the
 *    operator-configured dashboard URL, so this deployment owns no delivery
 *    infrastructure (`publicBaseUrl: null`) and answers test deliveries
 *    with a fail-closed domain error.
 *  - In development with paymob active, a tunnel channel is eligible only
 *    when BOTH the ngrok authtoken and the reserved public domain are
 *    configured AND the tunnel's own readiness sequence succeeds — the
 *    channel spawns the ngrok agent and probes the PUBLIC reserved-domain
 *    URL, so the decision covers the whole acquisition, not just the
 *    configuration keys.
 *  - Every other development case — tunnel keys absent, or the tunnel not
 *    usable — resolves the simulation channel, with exactly ONE structured
 *    info log naming the fallback reason. Tunnel configuration is optional
 *    operator setup: it is never an error and never blocks development.
 *
 * The resolved channel is a lazy singleton (same shape as the payment
 * gateway factory): `resetCallbackChannel()` drops it together with the
 * shared env snapshot, so configuration swaps take effect on the next
 * resolution without a process restart.
