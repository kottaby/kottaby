/**
 * Simulation callback channel — the fully implemented development default.
 *
 * When no tunnel serves the local dev server, this channel keeps the ENTIRE
 * callback pipeline live offline: it synthesizes a Paymob-shaped processed
 * callback (the nested `obj` carrying every documented signed member), signs
 * it with the PRODUCTION HMAC message builder under the configured
 * `PAYMOB_HMAC_SECRET`, and POSTs it as `?hmac=<digest>` to the local
 * webhook receiver — the exact wire shape a real provider delivery takes, so
 * the delivery passes the same signature gate, normalization, amount
 * quarantine, and once-only guarded transition as production traffic. There
 * is deliberately NO parallel signer: the production builder is the only
 * message implementation involved.
 *
 * Determinism is a feature: synthesis derives every value from the delivery
 * arguments alone (no clock, no randomness), so delivering the same
 * arguments twice reproduces byte-identical bodies and signatures — the
 * provider's duplicate-delivery semantics — while distinct references yield
 * distinct transaction ids. Cross-user scenarios are driven the same way:
 * purchase as different test users, then deliver each payment's reference.
 *
 * The channel is reachable only outside production runtimes. The factory
 * never selects it there, and a fail-closed runtime guard inside both public
 * methods throws if it is ever invoked anyway.
