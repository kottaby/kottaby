/**
 * AdminFinancialAuditingService — the admin control room over the two money
 * ledgers (`student_payments` + `teacher_transaction`): the payments audit
 * view, the teacher wallet inspection, the pending-withdrawal settlement
 * queue, and the three financial mutations (approve / reject / adjust).
 *
 * File layout: the read path (the three list surfaces, the consistent-
 * snapshot wrapper, and the pagination plumbing) lives in the sibling
 * `admin-financial-auditing.service.read.helpers.ts` module (extracted
 * verbatim); every list method below is a one-to-one delegation wrapper,
 * so the public API (names, signatures, behavior) is unchanged.
 *
 * The three list surfaces are pure paginated reads: the admin gate first,
 * then the paired count + listing inside ONE repeatable-read transaction
 * (the audit-trail precedent) so `totalCount` and `items` can never tear
 * across a concurrent producer commit. When no outer transaction is
 * supplied, the count + page pair shares its own snapshot; the surrounding
 * identity and probe reads (admin gate, wallet probes, settlement probes)
 * run on a SEPARATE top-level transaction and are best-effort,
 * non-authoritative reads outside that snapshot — no write decision ever
 * trusts them. The payments view never writes; inspection never fabricates
 * a wallet row — a wallet-less teacher renders the honest null-pair state
 * with the teacher identity still resolved.
 *
 * The three mutations compose a guarded ledger/wallet write with an audit
 * insert in ONE transaction:
 *  - approve settles a pending withdrawal (`completed`) via the guarded
 *    `settleWithdrawalOnce` predicate — the debit already happened at
 *    request time, so the balance NEVER moves again;
 *  - reject settles the same row to `failed` AND restores the reserved
 *    debit to the wallet balance in the same transaction;
 *  - adjust books a bonus (credit) or a marked withdrawal (debit) with a
 *    mandatory reason; `total_earning` is NEVER touched by an adjustment.
 * Every mutation writes exactly ONE audit row through the single writer
 * `AuditService.createAuditLog`, sharing the transaction's commit/rollback
 * fate — a rolled-back mutation leaves no ledger row and no audit row.
 *
 * Conventions per `backend/services/AGENTS.md` (mirroring `WalletService`):
 * every user-facing message resolves through `getServerTranslations(locale)`;
 * expected rejections log via `logger.logDomainError` with bounded context
 * only — never amounts, never other users' wallet ids, never reason text;
 * rejections are typed DomainErrors whose `extensions.code` propagates
 * uncaught to the masking boundary. `assertActorAdmin` runs FIRST inside the
 * transaction — anonymous callers (`actorId = 0`) receive
 * `UnauthorizedError`, non-admins `ForbiddenError`, and denials write ZERO
 * audit rows. No `{ ...input }` spreads anywhere — every repo payload is a
 * field-by-field copy. No module-level mutable state; no swallowed catches.
