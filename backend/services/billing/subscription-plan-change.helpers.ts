/**
 * SubscriptionAdmin plan-change flow — the upgrade/downgrade lifecycle
 * writer, split into its own module (the sibling-helpers file convention)
 * so the `SubscriptionAdminService` namespace stays focused on
 * orchestration-sized flows. The duplicate-claim REPLAY half (the
 * claim-key builder, the serialized-probe resolver, and the 23505 race
 * resolver) lives in the sibling `subscription-plan-change.replay.helpers.ts`
 * module — same extraction convention.
 *
 * Semantics: the source row must be `active` (a missing row denies with
 * the canonical not-found error, an already-cancelled row surfaces the
 * idempotent replay conflict, any other state the localized active-only
 * deny — the guarded-cancel disambiguation ladder reused verbatim), and
 * the TARGET plan must be active, different from the source plan, and
 * credit the SAME balance lane (cross-lane migration is out of scope).
 * The proration is computed from the student's CURRENT lane balance read
 * inside the transaction under the owner row's `FOR UPDATE` lock — the
 * lock (held to the transaction's end) serializes the read→settle pair
 * with concurrent lane debits, so a booking can never commit between the
 * balance read and the EXACT-value lane settlement (which still lands one
 * prepared total, never a relative increment).
 *
 * The idempotency claim
 * `subscription-admin:planChange:<sourceId>:<targetPlanId>` (minted under
 * the reserved server-owned namespace the purchase boundary refuses to
 * carry) is inserted (savepoint-bracketed) BEFORE any result write — the
 * flow's atomicity point. A duplicate REPLAYS the first result through
 * the claim's subscription pointer instead of re-crediting: the
 * serialized probe resolves a claim committed by an EARLIER call (its
 * source row is already `cancelled`) before the source-status guard, and
 * the savepoint-bracketed 23505 handler covers the concurrent window; a
 * committed claim that cannot resolve to a same-owner row surfaces the
 * localized already-plan-changed conflict. On the winning path the old
 * row is guarded-flipped to `cancelled` (fail closed on a zero-row
 * result — no disambiguation: the opening read already certified the
 * row's state under this transaction), the owner's lane is set to the
 * prepared exact total (the target plan's full session count plus the
 * computed carry on the upgrade leg; the downgrade forfeits the
 * remainder), the fresh period + junction row + claim backfill commit
 * together, and exactly ONE audit row (`Override` on the `subscription`
 * entity, details `{ direction, fromSubscriptionId, fromPlanId, toPlanId,
 * carrySessions, forfeitedExcess }` — enum values, ids, and integers
 * only) shares the transaction's fate.
 *
 * Runtime only — no types are declared here; every shape lives in
 * `backend/types/` and is imported through `@/backend/types`.
