/**
 * SubscriptionService — business-logic hub for the subscription-request
 * domain (DEV1-006 Phase A: offline-payment groundwork; Phase B: the admin
 * payment-verification transition; DEV1-009: the admin lifecycle surface —
 * the filtered all-statuses list + the cancel transition).
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 *  1. `requestPlanSubscription` — the purchase entry point. Inside ONE
 *     transaction it: probes the caller's unresolved duplicate request
 *     (`SUBSCRIPTION_REQUEST_EXISTS`), re-validates plan activeness under
 *     the row lock (`lockActivePlanById` — decision D2's deferred
 *     obligation: a deactivated plan can never be purchased while inactive,
 *     INV-PC1), and inserts the PENDING subscription row. The created row
 *     carries NO payment data and NO dates — the payment-confirmation
 *     stage (admin-verified offline payments per decision B.9) owns the
 *     activation transition.
 *  2. `listMySubscriptions` — the owner-scoped read behind the storefront's
 *     pending-request state. Ownership is the resolver's `ctx.user.id` —
 *     there is NO cross-user subscription read at this phase.
 *  3. `listPendingSubscriptionRequests` — the ADMIN verification-queue read
 *     (Phase B): every PENDING request with its plan and a narrow purchaser
 *     summary, oldest first. No mutation surface.
 *  4. `verifySubscriptionPayment` — the payment-confirmation transition
 *     (Phase B): pure validations → existence/status probe → guarded
 *     `pending → active` write that stamps the offline-payment columns and
 *     derives the validity window from the plan's CURRENT intervalDays.
 *     Balance crediting stays DEV1-007's concern — this touches ONLY the
 *     subscription row.
 *  5. `listAllSubscriptionsForAdmin` — the ADMIN lifecycle-list read
 *     (DEV1-009): every subscription in ALL statuses unless a narrowed
 *     `status` filter says otherwise, newest first, bounded pagination
 *     (clamped 1..100, offset floor 0 — the audit-trail discipline).
 *  6. `cancelSubscription` — the admin cancel transition (DEV1-009):
 *     guarded `active|pending → cancelled` write + in-transaction audit
 *     row. Expired/cancelled/suspended rows are terminal and reject.
 *
 * Disciplines (mirroring `PlanCatalogService`):
 *  - Validation is pure and precedes any write; ids must be positive
 *    integers (rejected with the localized plan-not-found copy).
 *  - All user-facing strings resolve through
 *    `getServerTranslations(locale).errorsTranslations`; no hardcoded
 *    messages, no raw constraint names, no print-style logging.
 *  - Expected rejections go through `logger.logDomainError` with payloads
 *    limited to ids + machine code; the audit seam emits a structured
 *    transition marker only (DEV3-020 attaches here — sanctioned deferral
 *    D1, same seam contract as the plan-catalog service).
 *  - Subscription row shaping is BOPLA: the service accepts `userId` +
 *    `planId` and nothing else — the caller cannot forge status, dates, or
 *    payment columns through any surface here.

   *     when omitted, the audit-trail discipline), `offset` floored at 0 —
   *     so a caller cannot request an unbounded page;
   *  3. the page read and the count read run against the SAME repository
   *     predicate (one composition, two consumers — the page and its total

   * Cancels a subscription (DEV1-009 — the admin cancel transition). Only

   * already-resolved conflict (a cancel can never resurrect or double-fire).
   *
   * Guard order (all inside ONE transaction):
   *  1. pure validation BEFORE the transaction opens — positive-integer
   *     subscription id;
   *  2. existence + status probe — a missing id rejects with
   *     `SUBSCRIPTION_NOT_FOUND`; a row outside the cancellable set rejects
   *     with `SUBSCRIPTION_ALREADY_RESOLVED` (the idempotency fence);
   *  3. the plan row is read PLAINLY (no active predicate — REQ-017
   *     posture, read AFTER the status probe exactly like
   *     `verifySubscriptionPayment`): cancelling a subscription whose plan
   *     was deactivated afterwards stays a legitimate administrative act;
   *  4. the guarded write (`cancelById`) flips `active|pending → cancelled`
   *     in ONE conditional statement; a zero-row outcome (a concurrent
   *     verification or cancellation won the predicate between the probe
   *     and the write) re-probes and rejects with
   *     `SUBSCRIPTION_ALREADY_RESOLVED` — exactly one transition ever wins,
   *     mirroring the verification race handling verbatim;
   *  5. the narrow purchaser summary is read (3 columns — never the full
   *     `users` row) to compose the canonical wire shape.
   *
   * Audit: one immutable `suspend`-family row (`SUBSCRIPTION_CANCELLED`,
   * extras `{ cancelledBy }`) rides the SAME transaction (fail-closed —
   * DEV3-020).
   *
   * Balance/credit semantics: cancelling does NOT refund, credit, or adjust
   * anything — DEV1-007 owns `students.balance_*`; this transition touches
   * ONLY the subscription row (plus its audit twin).
   *
   * @param input  `subscriptionId` and `cancelledBy` (the cancelling
   *     session's admin id — rides into the immutable audit row).
   * @param outerTx  Optional outer transaction — when provided (test path),
   *     the flow runs inside a SAVEPOINT on it; otherwise a top-level
   *     transaction opens.
   * @returns The cancelled subscription row with its plan row AND the
   *     narrow purchaser summary embedded (the canonical `AdminSubscription`
   *     wire shape).
   * @throws ValidationError when the id is not a positive integer or the
   *     plan reference is dangling (defensive — FK restrict makes it
   *     unreachable in practice).
   * @throws ConflictError with code `SUBSCRIPTION_NOT_FOUND` when the id
   *     references no row.
   * @throws ConflictError with code `SUBSCRIPTION_ALREADY_RESOLVED` when
   *     the row is expired/cancelled/suspended (terminal) or lost a
