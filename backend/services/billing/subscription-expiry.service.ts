/**
 * SubscriptionExpiryService — the system-scope expiry sweep that retires
 * past-window subscription cohorts and settles their credited balances.
 *
 * The scheduled caller (a fail-closed cron route) delegates here; the sweep
 * is ONE transaction for the whole cohort:
 *
 *   1. ONE captured `now` — a single clock reading governs every window
 *      comparison and every settlement decision in the sweep;
 *   2. the guarded batch flip — `SubscriptionRepository.expireDueActive`
 *      moves every `active` row whose validity window has closed to
 *      `expired` and reports the flipped rows' `{ id, userId, planId }`
 *      projections; a zero-row result is the replay/no-op branch, so a
 *      repeated or overlapping sweep converges on the same terminal state;
 *   3. plan-lane resolution — ONE batched read of the expired rows' plan
 *      ids resolves each plan's credited balance lane on the same
 *      transaction (one `inArray` round-trip, never per-row reads);
 *   4. conditional lane zeroing — each DISTINCT (owner, lane) pair is
 *      zeroed at most once through
 *      `StudentRepository.zeroLaneIfNoCoveringSubscription`, the guarded
 *      statement that skips lanes still covered by another `active` or
 *      `pending` subscription and leaves the trial balance structurally
 *      unreachable. Every zeroing runs on the sweep's transaction, so a
 *      flip and its zeroings commit together or not at all.
 *
 * Configuration gaps fail safe, not silent: a plan row whose credited lane
 * was never configured (NULL `balance_lane`) is skipped with one correlated
 * warning — its subscription is still flipped, only the zeroing is
 * withheld. An out-of-vocabulary stored lane (unreachable through the pg
 * enum — code/vocabulary drift) or a vanished plan row (the FK restrict
 * makes it unreachable while a subscription references the plan) aborts the
 * whole cohort closed: the transaction rolls back, nothing is half-swept.
 *
 * The return is counts-only (`{ expired, lanesZeroed }`): honest counts
 * produced by the guarded statements, no row identities — the scheduled
 * envelope carries it verbatim, and a replayed sweep honestly reports
 * `{ expired: 0, lanesZeroed: 0 }`. There is deliberately NO notification
 * fan-out and NO audit write: the sweep is system-scope and actor-less, so
 * no notification recipient and no audit actor exists — observability is
 * the structured log lines (ids and counts only, never payloads) plus the
 * returned counts.
 *
 * `outerTx` is the canonical test-path seam (a caller-owned transaction
 * runs the sweep as a SAVEPOINT on it); production callers omit it and the
 * sweep opens its own transaction. With a caller-owned transaction, an
 * induced mid-cohort failure rolls back only the savepoint — the outer
 * transaction stays usable, which is what the atomicity probe asserts.
