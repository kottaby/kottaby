/**
 * SubscriptionAdminService — admin-gated lifecycle operations on the
 * `subscriptions` root (the extend surface lives here; the sibling
 * admin flows join the same namespace as they ship).
 *
 * Every mutation mirrors the shipped billing admin surface: the acting
 * admin's id is a required parameter that is re-asserted against the
 * `users` table (defense in depth behind the GraphQL role scope) BEFORE
 * any write, the guarded single-statement transition plus its exactly-one
 * audit row share ONE `withTransaction` block (a rolled-back mutation
 * leaves no window shift and no audit row), and denials emit one bounded
 * `logger.logDomainError` with ids only — never student-identifying
 * data.
 *
 * Extend semantics: the new window end is computed SERVER-SIDE from the
 * row's stored `endDate` (a client can never dictate a target date).
 * Genuinely new extensions stack legitimately — each call re-reads the
 * row and extends from its current window — while an identical replay
 * that lost the guarded race surfaces an idempotent conflict instead of
 * a second shift.
 *
 * Renew semantics: the source row must be `expired` — the expiry sweep
 * owns the active → expired transition, so renewal is the recovery path
 * for a lapsed period (an active row takes extend; a pending row is
 * payment-owned). A fresh plan read supplies the period arithmetic and
 * the credit lane (fail-closed when the lane is not configured), the new
 * row opens at the renewal instant, and the owner's lane is credited the
 * plan's full session count. The idempotency claim
 * `subscription-admin:renew:<sourceId>` (minted under the reserved
 * server-owned namespace the purchase boundary refuses to carry) is
 * inserted before any result write — the flow's atomicity point: a
 * duplicate renew replays the first result through the claim's
 * subscription pointer instead of creating a second period, while a
 * committed claim that cannot resolve to a same-owner row (its result
 * row was deleted — the set-null FK) surfaces the localized
 * already-renewed conflict.
 *
 * Cancel semantics: the source row must be `active`, and the flip is
 * BALANCE-PRESERVING — no lane balance column is read or written anywhere
 * in the flow (deliberately asymmetric with the expiry sweep, which
 * zeroes). The optional free-text reason is the audit trail's only free
 * text: trimmed and bounded server-side before anything else runs. A
 * zero-row guarded flip is disambiguated by a fresh read — an
 * already-cancelled row is the idempotent replay conflict, a vanished row
 * the canonical not-found denial, any other state the localized
 * active-only deny.
 *
 * Plan-change semantics: the source row must be `active` and its TARGET
 * plan active, different, and same-lane (cross-lane migration is out of
 * scope). The proration is computed in exact BigInt minor units from the
 * student's CURRENT lane balance for the old lane (read under the owner
 * row's `FOR UPDATE` lock so the read→settle pair serializes with
 * concurrent lane debits). The
 * `subscription-admin:planChange:<sourceId>:<targetPlanId>` claim is the
 * flow's atomicity point — a duplicate REPLAYS the first
 * result — and the winning path flips the old row to `cancelled` through
 * the guarded transition, settles the owner's lane to the prepared exact
 * total (the target plan's full session count plus the computed carry on
 * the upgrade leg; the downgrade forfeits the remainder), opens the fresh
 * period, and writes exactly ONE `Override` audit row on the NEW row.
 *
 * List semantics: the admin read surface is READ-ONLY — one owner-scoped
 * query (`user_id` = the addressed id, newest first by the repository's
 * own `created_at DESC` ordering) mapped onto the canonical ReturnType;
 * no writes, no audit rows. The acting admin is re-asserted against the
 * `users` table BEFORE any read (defense in depth behind the GraphQL
 * role scope — zero reads on denial), the owner id is re-validated
 * through the strict numeric coercion (a malformed id is the canonical
 * localized VALIDATION denial, never a silent mis-target), and a
 * well-formed but unknown id is the indistinguishable empty list.
