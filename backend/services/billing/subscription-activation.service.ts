/**
 * SubscriptionActivationService — the webhook-facing activation flow for
 * subscription purchases.
 *
 * The route layer (transport) hands this service an ALREADY-VERIFIED
 * `PaymentWebhookEvent` (signature + size + parse happen upstream); the
 * service owns the settlement decision and every side effect. The flow is a
 * fixed sequence of fail-closed stages:
 *
 *   1. reference correlation — a non-transactional read finds the
 *      subscription by its gateway `paymentReference`. An unknown reference
 *      mutates NOTHING, logs one bounded warning (never an error storm) and
 *      answers `{ processed: false }` so the gateway can stop retrying;
 *   2. settlement quarantine — the stored payment row's amount/currency are
 *      compared with the event's claimed values. Any disagreement mutates
 *      NOTHING and logs one `logger.error` carrying correlation ids only
 *      (never raw payloads, never financial values): settlement integrity
 *      beats liveness;
 *   3. `confirmed` — ONE transaction decides: the payment row's status is
 *      read first for PATH SELECTION ONLY (every state change below is
 *      decided by a guarded UPDATE that re-verifies the predicate itself —
 *      the guards are the arbiter, never the pre-read). `failed` → the
 *      delivery is REJECTED and logged (a decided payment is terminal — no
 *      silent upgrade); `paid` → idempotent replay; `pending` → the
 *      activation sequence: the plan row is re-read in-transaction (a NULL
 *      balance lane QUARANTINES the delivery — an admin can clear a plan's
 *      lane after the purchase commits — nothing mutated, one correlated
 *      error log, `{ processed: false }`), `activatePendingOnce` flips the
 *      subscription (zero rows ⇒ replay: NO credit, NO second
 *      notification), `markPaidOnce` decides the payment — recording the
 *      event's provider transaction reference in the SAME guarded
 *      statement when one is present (the one-time NULL → value allowance
 *      the immutability trigger admits, so the auditable provider link is
 *      written exactly when the decision is) — the full
 *      `sessionCount` is credited to the plan's lane, and the
 *      `payment_confirmation` notification is persisted in the SAME
 *      transaction — its copy composed in the RECIPIENT's persisted locale
 *      (the users row's `locale`, falling back to `defaultLocale` when the
 *      user never chose one — the session-request-notification convention).
 *      The realtime fan-out publishes strictly AFTER the
 *      transaction commits — a publish failure never rolls back the
 *      committed activation (the persisted inbox row remains authoritative);
 *      a legacy plan row past the interval-days activation ceiling
 *      (`MAX_INTERVAL_DAYS`) or past the session-count credit ceiling
 *      (`MAX_SESSION_COUNT`) quarantines identically to the NULL lane —
 *      the Date window arithmetic must never run on an out-of-range value,
 *      and an over-ceiling credit would overflow the lane's int4 balance.
 *   4. `failed` — ONE transaction decides: the guarded `markFailedOnce`
 *      write (with the same one-time provider-reference recording when the
 *      event carries one) and, when it decided the payment, the FAILURE
 *      notification is persisted in the SAME transaction — the same
 *      `payment_confirmation` kind, subscription pointer, recipient-locale
 *      composition, and idempotency-key treatment as the confirmed copy;
 *      only the title/body copy differs (the failure copy names the
 *      attempted plan and the not-activated outcome). The subscription row
 *      is untouched (it stays `pending` for operator follow-up) and no
 *      credit runs. Zero rows ⇒ the payment was already decided — an
 *      idempotent replay ack with NO second notification.
 *
 * Notification copy is composed in the RECIPIENT's persisted locale, not
 * the caller-supplied one: the webhook is server-to-server (no session, no
 * per-request locale), so the per-recipient resolution is this flow's own
 * obligation — the in-transaction users read supplies the recipient's
 * stored `locale`, falling back to `defaultLocale` when the user row
 * carries none (the session-request-notification convention). The
 * caller-supplied locale remains the log/error attribution locale. The
 * emit carries the idempotency key `payment:<providerTransactionId>:confirmation`
 * whenever the verified event carries a provider transaction reference —
 * a belt-and-braces dedupe layered on the PRIMARY arbiter, which stays the
 * guarded transition itself: the zero-row guard guarantees the emit (and
 * the credit) run exactly once per payment. Events without a provider
 * reference (the mock adapter's deliveries) stay keyless — the guard
 * alone owns their dedupe.
 *
 * `outerTx` is the canonical test-path seam (a caller-owned transaction runs
 * the flow as a SAVEPOINT on it); production callers omit it and the flow
 * opens its own transaction. When supplied, it ALSO carries the two
 * pre-transaction reads and the failed-path decision write, so the whole
 * delivery participates in the caller's transaction instead of escaping to
 * the pool.
 *
 * `options` (optional) overrides the notification-engine call options for
 * BOTH the in-transaction emit and the post-commit publish. The production
 * default resolves the process-shared idempotency claim cache from the
 * configured environment; with no cache configured the engine degrades
 * fail-open (one structured warn per keyed emission) — a keyed domain
 * event is never blocked on cache health, and the guarded transition
 * remains the exactly-once arbiter either way.

   *    plan balance lane at activation time, a legacy plan row whose
   *    `intervalDays` exceeds the activation-window ceiling or whose
   *    `sessionCount` exceeds the credit ceiling, or a `confirmed`
   *    arriving after the payment failed (replay-incompatible).
   *
   * @param event  The verified gateway event (the transport already checked
   *     signature, size, and envelope — the service trusts the payload
   *     shape). A carried `providerTransactionId` is recorded on the payment
   *     row inside the guarded decision and keys the payment notification.
   * @param locale  Active locale for the error-message attribution and the
   *     post-commit publish; the notification COPY is composed in the
   *     recipient's persisted locale (resolved in-transaction).
   * @param outerTx  Optional caller-owned transaction (test path): the flow
   *     runs as a SAVEPOINT on it. Production callers omit it.
   * @param options  Optional notification-engine call override (the claim
   *     cache / fanout transport seam). Production callers omit it and the
   *     environment-resolved claim cache is used; the engine degrades
   *     fail-open when none is configured.
