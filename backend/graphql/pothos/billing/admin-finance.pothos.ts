/**
 * Admin financial-auditing ledger row objects — the canonical row shapes
 * behind the three admin read surfaces over the two money ledgers
 * (`student_payments` + `teacher_transaction`).
 *
 * Every shape is backed by a canonical type from `@/backend/types` (the
 * `admin-finance.types.ts` set Task 2.2 shipped):
 *  - `AdminStudentPayment` ← `AdminStudentPaymentRow` (payment + student
 *    identity join — one rendered row)
 *  - `AdminWithdrawalQueueRow` ← `AdminWithdrawalQueueRow` (pending
 *    settlement queue row: the pending `TeacherTransaction` + identity +
 *    reserved balance)
 *
 * Per `backend/graphql/pothos/AGENTS.md`:
 *  - NO local type definitions — all shapes come from `@/backend/types`.
 *  - `id` is exposed FIRST on every row object (Apollo cache
 *    normalization — the `AdminStudentPayment` and `AdminWithdrawalQueueRow`
 *    wrappers' normalizable entities carry it; the queue row itself is an
 *    embedded value object with NO `id`, so its normalizable identity is
 *    the `TeacherTransaction` inside `transaction`).
 *  - Money fields ride the shared `DateTime` scalar convention + decimal
 *    STRINGS verbatim (money discipline: never numbers, never floats).
 *  - `paymentGateway`/`status` are re-exposed over the canonical Pothos
 *    enums registered ONCE in `shared/enum.pothos.ts` — the canonical rows
 *    already carry the TS enum values, so these are structural passthroughs.
 *  - The `TeacherTransaction` object is REUSED from
 *    `pothos/billing/wallet.pothos.ts` (single canonical object rule) —
 *    never re-declared here.
