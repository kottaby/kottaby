/**
 * Admin subscription-management Pothos inputs — `ExtendSubscriptionInput`
 * + `RenewSubscriptionInput` + `CancelSubscriptionInput` +
 * `ChangeSubscriptionPlanInput` — plus the plan-change payload object
 * `ChangeSubscriptionPlanPayload` (the NEW row + the applied proration
 * settlement).
 *
 * Input types are the GraphQL schema's BOPLA boundary: the whitelist
 * carries exactly the fields the service accepts, so smuggled fields die
 * at GraphQL validation before a resolver ever runs. The wire
 * `subscriptionId` stays an `ID` and is coerced to the numeric row key
 * through the service's strict numeric parse; `days` is re-validated
 * server-side (whole number ≥ 1) — the GraphQL `Int` type alone does not
 * enforce the positivity floor for non-GraphQL callers.
 *
 * String-named `inputType` per the AGENTS input pattern (never
 * `inputRef<BackendType>`); registered ahead of its resolver module
 * through the billing Pothos barrel. The mutations return the existing
 * canonical `StudentSubscription` object — no new object type exists for
 * the admin surface.
 *
 * `RenewSubscriptionInput` carries the expired-source selector only: the
 * renewal's plan snapshot, window arithmetic, credit lane, and the
 * server-constructed idempotency claim are all derived server-side from
 * the source row and its fresh plan read, so the wire payload has
 * nothing else to smuggle.
 *
 * `CancelSubscriptionInput` carries the active-source selector plus an
 * OPTIONAL free-text reason: the flip is balance-preserving (no lane
 * field exists to smuggle), and the reason is trimmed and bounded
 * server-side before it can reach the audit trail — the wire length is
 * advisory only.
 *
 * `ChangeSubscriptionPlanInput` carries the active-source selector and
 * the target plan id ONLY: the proration direction, the carry/forfeit
 * arithmetic, the same-lane compatibility, and the server-constructed
 * `planChange:<sourceId>:<targetPlanId>` idempotency claim are all
 * derived server-side — the payload cannot claim a direction or a session
 * amount. The payload object composes the canonical `StudentSubscription`
 * (single canonical object type — no new subscription shape) with the
 * registered `ProrationDirection` enum and the two integer settlement
 * fields.
