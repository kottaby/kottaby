/**
 * EvaluationPothosObject — the single canonical GraphQL object type for an
 * evaluation row, plus the star-rating input for the student→teacher
 * session-rating submission.
 *
 * Single Canonical Object Type Pattern (`backend/graphql/AGENTS.md`):
 *  - Backed EXCLUSIVELY by the canonical `EvaluationReturnType` from
 *    `@/backend/types` — no local type definitions here. The service
 *    (`StudentEvaluationService`) is the only producer of that closed shape,
 *    which strips the soft-delete internals (`isDeleted`/`deletedAt`), the
 *    free-text `notes`, and the server-managed `updatedAt` stamp — none of
 *    those columns are exposed here (BOPLA: the wire shape can never leak
 *    them, because the backing type does not carry them).
 *  - `Evaluation` exposes `id` FIRST (Apollo cache normalization), then the
 *    rated subject and rater ids, the nullable session join, the nullable
 *    0-100 score, and the creation instant. Nullability mirrors the columns:
 *    applicant evaluations and session deletions leave `sessionId` NULL, the
 *    score column is nullable, `createdAt` is NOT NULL.
 *  - `SubmitTeacherEvaluationInput` is the student-controlled whitelist:
 *    exactly the whole-star `rating` (the service converts it to the stored
 *    score and derives every other column server-side — no session id, no
 *    evaluator id, no score on the input). Defined with the string-named
 *    `inputType` form, never `inputRef` (the input's nullability must not
 *    couple to the backend type's exact shape).
 *  - NO enum registration and NO inline business logic — every field is a
 *    structural passthrough.
 *
 * Consumed by the `submitTeacherEvaluation` mutation and the
 * `myTeacherEvaluations` query resolver modules, whose imports transitively
 * register both types through the `gqlSchema.ts` side-effect chain (the
 * teachers domain keeps that transitive-registration convention; the top
 * Pothos barrel deliberately does not list it).
