/**
 * Session arbitration queries — `adminDisputeCase` (the admin's
 * case-review read over one disputed session, the evidence bundle behind
 * the arbitration decision) and `teacherDisputeCase` (the session's own
 * teacher's participant-side transparency bundle).
 *
 * Contract:
 *  - `adminDisputeCase(id: ID!): AdminDisputeCase!` — the full session row
 *    (dispute reason, stamps, fee, hold marker), the session report, the
 *    homework record, the recitation record, and the session-scoped audit
 *    trail, in ONE response. Artifacts that were never produced surface as
 *    honest `null`s (`report`/`homework`/`recitation`) or an empty trail —
 *    never fabricated placeholders. An unknown or malformed id surfaces as
 *    the localized not-found denial (the admin surface distinguishes
 *    state, never participants). The read is strictly side-effect free.
 *
 * authScopes (`$all` conjunction, MANDATORY — shared admin prelude):
 *  - `authScopes: adminOnlyAuthScopes` (the canonical
 *    `$all { authenticated: true, role: [UserRole.Admin] }` conjunction).
 *    Anonymous → `UNAUTHORIZED` (401); authenticated non-admin →
 *    `FORBIDDEN` (403) — both BEFORE the resolver body runs.
 *  - A plain `{ authenticated: true, role: [...] }` map is WRONG: Pothos
 *    combines scope keys with ANY semantics unless `$all` makes the
 *    conjunction explicit.
 *  - Defense in depth: the service re-asserts the governance-clean ADMIN
 *    role from the user row (`assertAdminGovernanceClean`) before reading.
 *
 * Resolver discipline (thin resolvers):
 *  - Identity comes EXCLUSIVELY from the verified context
 *    (`requireAdminUser(ctx)` → `user.id`; never client input).
 *  - NO try/catch, NO business logic — service `DomainError` subclasses
 *    propagate with `extensions.code` and boundary masking; all localized
 *    messaging happens inside the service via `ctx.locale` propagation.
 *  - Zero repository calls; top-level static imports ONLY.
 *
 * Per `backend/graphql/query/AGENTS.md`:
 *  - NO named exports — the root field registers at import time via
 *    `gqlSchemaBuilder.queryField(...)`.
 *  - Wired through side-effect barrels:
 *    `query/classes/index.ts` → `query/index.ts` → `gqlSchema.ts`.
