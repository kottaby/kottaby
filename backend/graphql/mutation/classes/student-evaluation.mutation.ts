/**
 * Student evaluation mutation — the student-only `submitTeacherEvaluation`:
 * the write-once student→teacher rating of one completed session's teacher.
 *
 * Contract:
 *  - `submitTeacherEvaluation(sessionId: ID!, input: SubmitTeacherEvaluationInput!): Evaluation!`
 *      Student-only (`$all` scope conjunction). The acting student is
 *      resolved SERVER-side from `ctx.user.id` — never client-supplied
 *      (BOLA); the rated teacher is derived from the session row inside the
 *      service. Every business rule (the positive-safe-integer session id
 *      re-assertion, the whole-star 1..5 rating guard, the dual-confirmation
 *      completion gate, the one-rating-per-session write-once conflict, the
 *      `rating × 20` score conversion) lives in `StudentEvaluationService`.
 *
 * authScopes 401/403 split (mirrors `session-report.mutation.ts`, verified
 * against @pothos/plugin-scope-auth@4.1.7):
 *  - A plain `{ authenticated: true, role: [...] }` map is WRONG in this
 *    engine: Pothos combines the keys of ONE scope map with ANY semantics
 *    (`defaultStrategy: "any"`), so ANY authenticated caller would pass.
 *  - The conjunction is therefore made EXPLICIT with `$all`: anonymous
 *    callers hit the `authenticated` scope's UnauthorizedError throw
 *    (extensions.code UNAUTHORIZED / 401 — explicit throws pass through
 *    builder.ts's unauthorizedError mapping VERBATIM), while authenticated
 *    non-students fail the `role` scope into the canonical localized
 *    ForbiddenError (FORBIDDEN / 403).
 *
 * Resolvers are THIN DELEGATION ONLY (`backend/graphql/mutation/AGENTS.md`
 * + `backend/graphql/AGENTS.md`): no business logic, no repository calls,
 * no try/catch — DomainErrors from `StudentEvaluationService` propagate
 * uncaught to the masking boundary with their `extensions.code` untouched
 * (`SESSION_NOT_FOUND`, `EVALUATION_SESSION_NOT_COMPLETED`,
 * `EVALUATION_ALREADY_SUBMITTED`, `VALIDATION`); all localized messaging
 * happens inside the service via `ctx.locale` propagation — this file
 * carries NO resolver-local error copy and NO business branching.
 *
 * Per `backend/graphql/mutation/AGENTS.md`:
 *  - This file has NO named exports — it registers the root field at
 *    import time via `gqlSchemaBuilder.mutationField(...)`.
 *  - Wired via side-effect barrels: `mutation/classes/index.ts` →
 *    `mutation/index.ts` → `gqlSchema.ts`.
