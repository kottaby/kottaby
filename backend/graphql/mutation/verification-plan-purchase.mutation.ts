/**
 * `purchaseVerificationPlan` mutation — the teacher applicant's purchase of
 * the verification plan through the shared payment spine (the same
 * subscription/payment/idempotency pipeline the student purchase runs).
 *
 * Contract:
 *  - `purchaseVerificationPlan: PurchaseSubscriptionPayload!` — INPUTLESS:
 *    the wire carries zero client-owned fields (no plan selector, no
 *    purchaser id, no money value — BOLA/BOPLA-proof by construction). The
 *    purchaser identity is server-bound from `ctx.user.id` and the plan is
 *    resolved server-side from the ACTIVE catalog, so a payload structurally
 *    cannot carry a target or an amount.
 *  - The idempotency key is consumed EXACTLY as captured at the gateway
 *    (`ctx.idempotencyKey`, propagation-only): an absent header arrives as
 *    `null` and the service's own guard rejects it with the localized
 *    VALIDATION error, pre-DB. The key is never re-derived, never trimmed,
 *    and never consultable by any authorization decision.
 *  - DomainErrors (anonymous UNAUTHORIZED, the service-level applicant gate
 *    APPLICANT_NOT_FOUND / APPLICANT_COOLDOWN_ACTIVE /
 *    APPLICANT_ALREADY_CERTIFIED, missing-key VALIDATION, replay
 *    DUPLICATE_REQUEST conflict, the oracle-safe payment-not-found for a
 *    foreign key, plan denials) propagate uncaught to the masking boundary —
 *    no try/catch here.
 *
 * authScopes: `authenticated` only. The applicant eligibility predicate
 * (an `applicants` row in a purchasable state, cooldown rules included)
 * lives at the SERVICE level inside the purchase transaction — declaring a
 * role scope here would split one gate across two layers and lock out the
 * surface for legitimate applicant roles that carry no dedicated role check
 * (scope-composition rule in `backend/graphql/AGENTS.md`).
 *
 * Per `backend/graphql/mutation/AGENTS.md`:
 *  - NO named exports — the root field registers at import time via
 *    `gqlSchemaBuilder.mutationField(...)`.
 *  - Wired via side-effect barrels: `mutation/index.ts` → `gqlSchema.ts`.
 *  - Resolver delegates to the services layer with locale propagation;
 *    no business logic inline. Top-level static imports only.
