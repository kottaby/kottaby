/**
 * Admin subscription-management mutations — `adminExtendSubscription` +
 * `adminRenewSubscription` + `adminCancelSubscription` +
 * `adminChangeSubscriptionPlan`.
 *
 * Contract:
 *  - `adminExtendSubscription(input: ExtendSubscriptionInput!):
 *    StudentSubscription!` — admin-only; the acting admin's identity is
 *    server-bound from `ctx.user.id` (never from args — BOLA-safe by
 *    construction) and the new window end is computed server-side from
 *    the row's stored `endDate` (the payload cannot dictate a target
 *    date).
 *  - `adminRenewSubscription(input: RenewSubscriptionInput!):
 *    StudentSubscription!` — admin-only; the expired-source selector is
 *    the only client material. The renewal's plan snapshot, window
 *    arithmetic, lane credit, and the server-constructed
 *    `subscription-admin:renew:<sourceId>` idempotency claim (minted
 *    under the reserved server-owned namespace the purchase boundary
 *    refuses to carry) are all derived server-side. A
 *    duplicate renew REPLAYS the first result through the claim's
 *    subscription pointer (no error, no second period, no second
 *    credit); a claim that cannot resolve to a same-owner row surfaces
 *    the localized already-renewed conflict.
 *  - `adminCancelSubscription(input: CancelSubscriptionInput!):
 *    StudentSubscription!` — admin-only; flips an `active` row to
 *    `cancelled` through the guarded single UPDATE while touching NO lane
 *    balance (balance-preserving by design — the wire payload carries only
 *    the selector and an optional free-text reason that the service trims
 *    and bounds before the audit trail). An already-applied cancel
 *    surfaces the localized idempotent conflict instead of a second write.
 *  - `adminChangeSubscriptionPlan(input: ChangeSubscriptionPlanInput!):
 *    ChangeSubscriptionPlanPayload!` — admin-only; moves an `active` row
 *    onto a different ACTIVE plan crediting the SAME balance lane with
 *    prorated settlement: the direction is derived server-side from the
 *    two plans' unit values (a unit-value tie breaks on session count),
 *    the `subscription-admin:planChange:<sourceId>:<targetPlanId>` claim
 *    makes a duplicate REPLAY the first result, and the payload reports
 *    the NEW row plus the
 *    applied carry/forfeit (zeros on a replay — the replayed call moved
 *    nothing). Cross-lane targets, inactive targets, same-plan targets,
 *    and non-active sources all surface localized conflicts.
 *  - The subscription id arrives as a wire `ID` and is coerced to the
 *    numeric row key through the strict numeric parse
 *    (`coerceSubscriptionId`) before it reaches the service — a
 *    malformed id is the canonical subscription-not-found denial, never
 *    a silent mis-target. The wire input is copied FIELD-BY-FIELD into
 *    the service's closed submit whitelist — never a `{ ...input }`
 *    spread.
 *  - The audit row shares the service transaction's commit/rollback
 *    fate; DomainErrors (FORBIDDEN non-admin, VALIDATION day-count/
 *    ceiling, CONFLICT not-active/replay) propagate uncaught to the
 *    masking boundary — no try/catch here.
 *
 * authScopes (`adminOnlyAuthScopes` — the MANDATORY `$all` conjunction):
 *  - `{ $all: { authenticated: true, role: [Admin] } }` from the shared
 *    admin prelude. Anonymous → `UNAUTHORIZED` (401); authenticated
 *    non-admin → `FORBIDDEN` (403) — both BEFORE the resolver body runs.
 *    `requireAdminUser(ctx)` is the TypeScript-narrowing belt only.
 *
 * Per `backend/graphql/mutation/AGENTS.md`:
 *  - NO named exports — the root field registers at import time via
 *    `gqlSchemaBuilder.mutationField(...)`.
 *  - Wired through side-effect barrels:
 *    `mutation/billing/index.ts` → `mutation/index.ts` → `gqlSchema.ts`.
 *  - Resolver delegates to the services layer with locale propagation;
 *    no business logic inline. Top-level static imports only.
