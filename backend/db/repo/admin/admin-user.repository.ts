/**
 * AdminUserRepository — data-access layer for the admin user directory.
 *
 * Conventions per `backend/db/repo/AGENTS.md`:
 *  - All methods take `tx?: DBTransaction` as the OPTIONAL-LAST parameter.
 *    Reads branch on the supplied executor (`tx` when supplied, the global
 *    `db` handle when not); writes branch identically. The Drizzle builder
 *    API is shared by both `db` and `tx` so the same chain runs on either.
 *  - No prepared statements: directory filters are dynamic AND chains of
 *    scalar predicates (no `inArray`); writes are excluded from
 *    prepared-statement candidacy by repo policy.
 *  - No business logic, no permission checks, no localized strings — the
 *    service layer translates raw outcomes into typed `DomainError`s.
 *  - No `passwordHash` in any projection: read paths use an explicit
 *    `.select({...})` shape that omits the column; write paths use an
 *    explicit `.returning({...})` shape that omits it. The structural
 *    absence is enforced at the Drizzle column-pick layer (never at the
 *    type-system-only layer).
 *
 * Search sanitization boundary:
 *  - The directory search filter is the ONLY injection-sensitive surface.
 *    The service layer MUST escape LIKE wildcards (`escapeLikeWildcards`
 *    from `@/backend/lib/db`) AND wrap the escaped substring as `%…%`
 *    BEFORE composing the `AdminUserFiltersSubmitInput` →
 *    `NormalizedAdminUserFilters` map. The repo receives the final
 *    escaped AND `%…%`-wrapped pattern string in
 *    `NormalizedAdminUserFilters.searchPattern` and binds it directly
 *    to the `ilike(column, pattern)` predicate — never re-escaping or
 *    re-wrapping. A second sanitizer in the repo would diverge over time
 *    and re-open the wildcard-injection surface; the contract is one
 *    canonical escape point (the service) + one canonical binding point
 *    (the repo's `ilike`).

   *
   * The WHERE predicate uses NULL-safe inverse-state guards so a legacy
   * NULL row reads correctly under three-valued SQL logic:

   * (because `is_deleted` is now `true`, not `false`/NULL) and the
   * statement returns zero rows — the service layer translates that
   * into the typed conflict (`USER_ALREADY_DELETED`) via a follow-up
   * `existsById` probe.
