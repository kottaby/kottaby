/**
 * StudentPaymentRepository — data-access layer for the `student_payments`
 * payment ledger.
 *
 * The table is IMMUTABLE at the database layer: a BEFORE UPDATE trigger
 * permits exactly one mutation — the status lifecycle `pending → paid` or
 * `pending → failed` with every financial/identity column frozen
 * (`student_id`, `subscription_id`, `amount`, `currency`, `payment_gateway`,
 * `created_at`) — and a BEFORE DELETE trigger blocks removal entirely.
 * Every violated expectation raises an exception from the trigger.
 *
 * Consequently the decision writes are single guarded UPDATEs
 * (`markPaidOnce` / `markFailedOnce`) whose `status = 'pending'` predicate
 * is the concurrency lock: a replayed delivery matches zero rows and the
 * caller replays instead of re-deciding. No SELECT-then-UPDATE anywhere,
 * and no column other than `status` / `updated_at` is ever written — the
 * repo and the trigger agree on the single permitted exception.
 *
 * Reads follow the `backend/db/repo/AGENTS.md` "Neon HTTP Client for Bare
 * Reads (CRITICAL)" rule: non-transactional reads run as raw parameterized SQL
 * through `queryDb` (Neon HTTP fast path when eligible); when a transaction is
 * supplied, the read executes as a Drizzle select on that executor.
 *
 * Write methods take an optional `tx: DBTransaction` as their last parameter.
