/**
 * SubscriptionRepository — data-access layer for the `subscriptions` table
 * (DEV1-006 Phase A: the subscription-request groundwork; Phase B: the
 * admin payment-verification transition; DEV1-009: the admin lifecycle
 * surface — the filtered all-statuses list + the cancel transition).
 *
 * A subscription row is created PENDING by construction: `status` rides the
 * schema default (`subscription_status` = 'pending'), `start_date` /
 * `end_date` / `payment_*` columns stay NULL until the payment-confirmation
 * stage activates the subscription. DEV1-006 Phase B owns the FIRST
 * transition: `verifyAndActivatePending` — the guarded `pending → active`
 * write that stamps the offline-payment columns (decision B.9). DEV1-009
 * owns the SECOND admin transition: `cancelById` — the guarded
 * `active|pending → cancelled` write whose predicate leaves
 * expired/cancelled/suspended rows (terminal states) permanently unmatched.
 *
 * Conventions per `backend/db/repo/AGENTS.md`:
 *  - Writes are single statements (INSERT … RETURNING) — no read-then-write.
 *  - `tx` is the LAST parameter of every method; passing it joins the
 *    caller's transaction, omitting it executes standalone.
 *  - No business rules, no translations, no log strings — callers translate
 *    empty results and driver errors into domain outcomes.
 *  - The ACTIVE-visibility predicate for purchase authorization is NOT
 *    re-implemented here: `lockActivePlanById` SELECTs the `plans` row
 *    through a guarded predicate under `FOR UPDATE` — the read-side twin of
 *    `PlanRepository.setActiveStatusOnce`'s guarded write (decision D2:
 *    purchase-time re-validation closes INV-PC1 against a deactivate racing
 *    a checkout; the row lock serializes the two).
