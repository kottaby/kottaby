/**
 * SessionRepository arbitration helpers — the implementations of the
 * post-confirmation dispute primitives, extracted behind the public
 * `SessionRepository` namespace (the max-lines refactor pattern of the
 * sibling helpers modules; the namespace binds them one-to-one so the
 * public API is unchanged). Nothing in this module is part of the public
 * API.
 *
 * The two guarded writes are single conditional UPDATE statements: the
 * full predicate (row identity + participant + lifecycle state + escrow
 * class) and the mutation share one statement, so predicate evaluation
 * happens under PostgreSQL's row lock with zero check-then-write window.
 * A transition that matches zero rows reports `null`; deciding WHY belongs
 * to the caller, which classifies via `findArbitrationProbe` — a cold-path
 * projection read that never feeds writes.
 *
 * Conventions carried over unchanged (per `backend/db/repo/AGENTS.md`):
 *  - every function takes `tx?: DBTransaction` as its LAST parameter;
 *    writes execute on `tx ?? db`, the probe read runs on the caller's
 *    transaction when supplied and falls back to raw parameterized SQL via
 *    `queryDb` otherwise;
 *  - no prepared statements, no SQL line-comment sequences, and the
 *    lifecycle vocabulary is carried by the `SessionStatus` enum members,
 *    never string literals;
 *  - no business logic, no permission checks, no i18n or logging — the
 *    caller decides what `null` means.
