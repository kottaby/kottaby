/**
 * EvaluationRepository — data-access layer for the `evaluations` table.
 *
 * An evaluation is a write-once score record shared by two flows: the
 * certified-sheikh evaluation of a teacher applicant (`session_id` NULL)
 * and the student→teacher session rating (`session_id` set, `score` on the
 * table's 0-100 scale the rating flow maps from whole stars). At most one
 * row may exist per (session_id, evaluator_id) pair: the table's
 * `evaluations_session_evaluator_unique` arbiter rejects duplicates with a
 * raw `23505` unique violation, so a pre-check INSERT guard would be a
 * pointless TOCTOU window. NULL `session_id` values are treated as
 * distinct by PostgreSQL unique semantics, so applicant evaluations never
 * collide.
 *
 * Conventions per `backend/db/repo/AGENTS.md`:
 *  - One `namespace` per repository file; the namespace name is the
 *    canonical export.
 *  - Writes take a REQUIRED `tx: DBTransaction` (last parameter) — they
 *    always join the caller's atomic unit of work and never fall back to
 *    the global handle. The insert payload is typed field-by-field (the
 *    four meaningful columns; schema defaults fill the rest).
 *  - Reads run on the caller's transaction (Drizzle select) when one is
 *    supplied and fall back to raw parameterized SQL via `queryDb` (the
 *    Neon-HTTP-eligible pattern) otherwise. The read is caller-scoped:
 *    the evaluator id is the ONLY filter — no parameter exists through
 *    which a caller could widen the read toward other evaluators or a
 *    chosen rated subject.
 *  - Soft-delete is exclusion-only: live rows are those whose
 *    `is_deleted` flag is false OR null (only an explicit deleted flag
 *    excludes — the same NULL-safe rule the platform analytics readers
 *    apply).
 *  - No prepared statements: the non-transactional read branch runs
 *    through `queryDb`, and the write is always transactional. No
 *    array-membership operators, no SQL line-comment sequences.
 *  - No business logic, no permission checks, no i18n or logging imports —
 *    the caller decides what an empty list or a raw constraint error
 *    means.
