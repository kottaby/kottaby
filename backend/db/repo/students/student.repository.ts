/**
 * StudentRepository — data-access layer for the `students` role-child table.
 *
 * The `students` row shares its PK with `users.id` (FK ON DELETE CASCADE) and
 * carries the `handshake_code` parent-linking identifier plus the zeroed
 * credit balances (`balance_hifz`, `balance_tajweed`, `balance_reviews`) and
 * the segregated one-time free-trial lane (`balance_trial`) guarded by the
 * `trial_granted_at` marker.
 *
 * Registration-path writes (`createForRegistration`) take a REQUIRED
 * `tx: DBTransaction` (last param) so the registration transaction can roll
 * back on any child-insert failure (atomicity). The trial grant method
 * (`grantFreeTrialOnce`) accepts an optional `tx` so it can run either inside
 * the registration transaction or standalone against the global handle.
 * Read methods (`findById`) use `queryDb` (raw parameterized SQL) on the
 * non-transactional branch for the Neon HTTP fast path, and Drizzle's query
 * builder on the transactional branch — per `backend/db/repo/AGENTS.md`.
