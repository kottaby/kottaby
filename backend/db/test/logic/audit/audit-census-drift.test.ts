/**
 * Admin-mutation ↔ audit-census anti-drift lock — a static, DB-free proof
 * that the shipped admin-gated GraphQL mutation inventory and the admin
 * action census (`test/workflows/admin/audit-completeness.catalog.ts`) stay
 * in exact bijection.
 *
 * Three mechanisms:
 *
 *  1. Corpus walk — a read-only, deterministically sorted `node:fs` traverse
 *     over `backend/graphql/mutation/**` collects every mutation source file
 *     (pattern shared with the sibling `audit-immutability.test.ts` suite by
 *     design decision; the suites stay siblings — this one pins the census
 *     contract, that one pins the append-only contract).
 *
 *  2. Gate classification — each `gqlSchemaBuilder.mutationField("<name>", …)`
 *     registration forms one chunk; the chunk's `authScopes` object literal is
 *     classified as admin-gated when a `role: [UserRole.Admin]` leg is
 *     present — in BOTH accepted forms (plain map and the `$all` conjunction).
 *     A gate the classifier cannot resolve (non-literal `authScopes` value,
 *     unbalanced literal, non-static role member) is RECORDED as a skip note,
 *     never silently dropped, and the skip ledger must stay empty for the
 *     current corpus.
 *
 *  3. Bijection — the extracted admin-gated field set must equal the census
 *     `wired` field set in BOTH directions: an unaudited admin mutation
 *     shipped without a census row fails, and a census row outliving its
 *     mutation fails. Deferred rows are excluded from the bijection (they
 *     name future surfaces) but must trace to an existing ledger row id in
 *     the plan's `deferred-items.md`.
 *
 * NON-VACUITY: the classifier and the bijection helper are pure functions
 * over (path → content) maps and are exercised against crafted in-memory
 * fixtures that MUST fire — plain-map and `$all` admin gates, non-admin and
 * public shapes, unresolvable gates, and drift injected in both directions —
 * so a broken scanner can never fake green.
 *
 * LEXICAL CAVEAT (accepted by design, mirroring the sibling suite): the scan
 * is text-level. A quoted field name inside a comment would be treated as a
 * registration (visible, cheap false positive); a variable-named registration
 * is deliberately obfuscated code that fails review anyway.
 *
 * DETERMINISM: file discovery sorts names with `localeCompare` at read time;
 * repeated traversals yield identical orderings.
 *
 * DB SAFETY: this suite performs ZERO database operations — pure filesystem +
 * regex proof; no `runInRollback` wrapper and no seed data are involved.
