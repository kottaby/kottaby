-- 5-teacher-transaction-settlement-sqlite.sql
-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- SQLite parity for 5-teacher-transaction-settlement.sql per
-- docs/SQLITE_LOCAL_DEV.md. Amends the teacher_transaction UPDATE guard so
-- withdrawal settlement (pending withdrawal -> completed | failed) is the
-- single permitted exception to the immutable wallet ledger; all
-- financial/identity columns (wallet_id, session_id, description, amount,
-- type, created_at) stay frozen — `updated_at` legitimately changes with the
-- settlement and is excluded from the freeze. Every other UPDATE aborts.
--
-- SQLite has no server-side stored functions, so the guard lives directly in
-- the trigger body (see 3-immutability-triggers-sqlite.sql). The strict
-- block-everything trigger must therefore be REPLACED here — `CREATE TRIGGER
-- IF NOT EXISTS` would silently keep the old version — hence DROP TRIGGER IF
-- EXISTS + CREATE TRIGGER.
--
-- Idempotency: DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS + CREATE TRIGGER. Safe to re-run any
--              number of times. Pure SQLite — NO PostgreSQL dependencies
--              (no plpgsql, no CREATE FUNCTION, no EXECUTE FUNCTION).
--
-- The DELETE guard (prevent_teacher_transaction_delete_trigger) is unchanged
-- and continues to block all deletes.
--
-- Dialect:    SQLite (libsql). PostgreSQL version lives in
--             5-teacher-transaction-settlement.sql.
