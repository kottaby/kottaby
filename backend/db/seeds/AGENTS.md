# Backend Database Seeds Layer

## Purpose

This directory contains all idempotent data seeders for local/development database bootstrapping. Each `seed-<entity>.ts` file exports a `seedOrGet(...)` function that returns either newly-inserted or existing records. Files are grouped by domain, mirroring the `backend/db/repo/`, `backend/types/`, `backend/enum/`, and `backend/graphql/` sub-directory layouts.

Each domain sub-directory contains its own `index.ts` barrel that re-exports each `seedOrGet` under a domain-qualified alias (e.g. `export { seedOrGet as seedOrGetTeachers } from "./seed-teachers";`). The top-level `backend/db/seeds/index.ts` master controller is the **only** file that imports individual seeders — it now imports them via the sub-directory paths (e.g. `@/backend/db/seeds/teachers/seed-teachers`) or, equivalently, the sub-directory barrel aliases.

## Rules

When creating or updating a seeder in this directory, you must adhere to the following rules:

### FORBIDDEN: System permissions (CRITICAL)

**Do not seed system permissions from this directory.** Rows in `permissions`, `permission_groups`, and `group_permissions` are owned exclusively by SQL under `backend/db/migration/` and applied via drizzle migrations under `backend/drizzle/`.

- **Never** insert/upsert into `permissions`, `permission_groups`, or `group_permissions` from a seeder
- **Never** call `PermissionManagementService.upsertSystemPermissions`, `ensureSystemPermissionGroup`, `ensureGroupPermissionsForGroups`, or `revokeGroupPermissions` from seeders
- New permission keys, system groups (`student_default`, `supervisor_default`, etc.), or group grants → add SQL under `backend/db/migration/` **and** a new drizzle migration folder under `backend/drizzle/`
- Seeders **may** assign users to existing groups (`user_permission_groups`) and seed `user_permission_overrides` (per-user overrides only)
- Demo student / supervisor logins come from `shared/demo-users.ts` → `seed-users.ts`; student domain rows from `students/seed-students.ts`. Groups must already exist from migrations before `seed-users` runs.

### Standard seeder rules

- **"seed or get" Pattern**: Every seeder MUST export a function named `seedOrGet`.
- **One Seeder per Table**: Every table must have its own dedicated seeder file (e.g. `seed-classes.ts`, `seed-class-instances.ts`). Do not combine distinct domains.
- **Idempotency**: The `seedOrGet` function must be safely runnable multiple times. Use look-before-create in the seeder (`orchestrateSeedMany` or explicit checks), then service bootstrap methods that handle duplicates (`onConflictDoUpdate`, `onConflictDoNothing`, or race recovery).
- **Return Value**: The function should return the seeded or retrieved entities. This allows other seeders to use those entities without querying the database again.
- **Dependencies via Controller Context**: If your seeder depends on data seeded by another seeder, the results should be passed from the master seeder controller (`index.ts`) through context, calling that seeder's `seedOrGet` function or accepting it as a parameter.

This ensures that we avoid duplicating data (such as permission groups or users) even if seeders are run multiple times.

- **Check Constraints**: Ensure your seeded data respects database-level `CHECK` constraints (e.g. `class_instances_state_machine_chk`). Check `backend/db/schema/*.ts` for these constraints to prevent seeding failures.
- **Enums Verification**: PostgreSQL enums must be matched EXACTLY. Check the `backend/db/schema/enums.ts` or `shared/lib/enum.ts` for the correct values (e.g., using `"ACTIVATED"` or `"REGULAR"` instead of `"ACTIVE"`). Do not guess valid statuses.
- **Schema Synchronization**: If you modified the database schema during your task (e.g. adding a column like `avatar_url`), you MUST run `bun run db push` to apply changes to the local database before running `bun run db seed`. Drizzle kit config (`drizzle.config.ts`) points at `./backend/db/schema/index.ts`, which resolves every table via the sub-directory barrels — no config change needed when adding sub-directories. **Note: `db reset` and `db cleanGenerate` are permanently disabled by repo policy** — use `db push` for schema changes and `db migrate` for migration management.
- **Type Safety**: Seeders do not query the database directly. Use canonical types from `@/backend/types` for entities passed between seeders and returned from services. If a type is missing, add it under `backend/types/` (one type file per domain) rather than using inline types or `any`. For many-row idempotent inserts, use `orchestrateSeedMany` from `@/backend/db/seeds/lib` with service `find*` / `list*` + `createMany*` / `upsert*` methods.

### File Organization
- Group seeders for the same domain in the matching sub-directory.
- File naming: `backend/db/seeds/<subdir>/seed-<entity>.ts` (e.g. `backend/db/seeds/teachers/seed-teachers.ts`).
- The pre-existing `lib/` and `assets/` directories are **not** part of this domain grouping — `lib/` holds shared factories and helpers imported by all seeders via `@/backend/db/seeds/lib`; `assets/` holds static seed data files.

### Adding New Seeders
1. Identify the matching sub-directory (or create a new one following the sub-directory convention).
2. Create `seed-<entity>.ts` in that sub-directory; expose `export async function seedOrGet(...) { ... }`.
3. Add `export { seedOrGet as seedOrGet<Entity> } from "./seed-<entity>";` to the sub-directory's `index.ts`.
4. Add the import + orchestration call to `backend/db/seeds/index.ts` (the master controller) so the new seeder runs in the correct dependency order.
5. If a new sub-directory was created, also add its `index.ts` barrel.

## Service-Only Data Access (CRITICAL)

Seeders **must not** import from `@/backend/db/**` (schema, repo, drizzleDb, migrations). ESLint enforces this via `no-restricted-imports` on `backend/db/seeds/**/*.ts`.

### Allowed imports in seeders

| Layer | Path pattern | Purpose |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| Services | `@/backend/services/**` | All database writes and reads |
| Seed lib | `@/backend/db/seeds/lib` | Factories, config, `seedOrGet` helpers |
| Types | `@/backend/types` | Entity shapes returned to the controller |
| Enums | `@/backend/enum/**` | Seed data constants |
| Storage bootstrap | `@/backend/storage/demo/**` | Physical file seeding only (no DB) |

### Forbidden in seeders

- `@/backend/db/drizzleDb`, `@/backend/db/schema/**`, `@/backend/db/repo/**`
- Direct `drizzle-orm` queries against application tables
- `batchInsert` (moved to `@/backend/db/repo/shared/bulk-upsert` — use service bootstrap methods instead)

When a bootstrap method is missing on a service, **add it to the service** (and repository if needed) rather than querying the DB from the seeder.

## Stable Key Registry

Use these service bootstrap entry points from seeders. Domain seed data (constants, specs) stays in the seeder or `lib/*-factory.ts`; persistence goes through services.

| Seeder domain | Service | Bootstrap method(s) |
|---------------|---------|---------------------|
| `auth/seed-user-permission-overrides` | `PermissionManagementService` | `ensureUserPermissionOverride` |
| `audit/seed-audit-logs` | `AuditService` | `countAuditLogs`, `listAuditLogs`, `createManyAuditLogs` |
| `audit/seed-admin-audit-logs` | `AuditService` | `countAdminAuditLogs`, `listAdminAuditLogs`, `createManyAdminAuditLogs` |
| `complaints/seed-complaints` | `ComplaintService` | `createManyComplaints` |
| `complaints/seed-complaint-responses` | `ComplaintService` | `ensureComplaintResponse` |
| `notifications/seed-user-notification-preferences` | `NotificationPreferencesService` | `upsertManyPreferences` |
| `notifications/seed-notification-deliveries` | `CommunicationService` | `createManyDeliveries` |
| `parents/seed-suggestions` | `SuggestionService` | `createManySuggestions` |
| `storage/seed-learning-resources` | `LearningResourceService` | `findByFilePath`, `insertResource` |
| `storage/seed-site-content` | `StorageService` | `upsertManySiteContent` |
| `meeting/seed-meeting-providers` | `MeetingProviderCatalogService` | `upsertManyProviders` |
| `shared/timezones` | `ReferenceDataService` | `upsertManyTimezones` |
| `shared/system-settings` | `SystemSettingsService` | `upsertManySettings`, `uploadHandbook`, `uploadParentHandbook` |
| File attachments | `StorageService` (via `lib/file-seed-helper`) | `linkFileToEntity` |

### Shared lib exports

- `orchestrateSeedMany` — idempotent many-row seeding helper (re-exported from `lib/index.ts`); coordinates look-before-create and duplicate-key race recovery via services
- `batchInsert` — **removed**; bulk inserts live in `@/backend/db/repo/shared/bulk-upsert` and are called from service bootstrap methods, not seeders

## Phased execution (`runSeedStep`)

`backend/db/seeds/index.ts` wraps each domain step with `runSeedStep` from `lib/run-seed-step.ts`. Failed steps are logged and collected in `context.failedSteps`, then passed to `verifySeedCoverage(failedSteps)` so coverage reporting distinguishes empty tables from earlier step failures.

## Asset checkpoint

- Manifest: `lib/asset-manifest.ts`
- Validator: `bun run validate:seed-assets` (also runs automatically in `backend/db/scripts/drizzleSeed.ts` for `standard` profile)
- Skip gate: `SEED_SKIP_ASSET_CHECK=true`
- Prompts for human-generated assets: `backend/db/seeds/prompts/`

## Additional bootstrap registry entries

| Seeder | Service | Bootstrap method(s) |
|--------|---------|---------------------|

| `classes/seed-class-categories` | `ClassCatalogService` | `findCategoriesBySlugs`, `upsertManyCategories` |
| `classes/seed-class-subjects` | `ClassCatalogService` | `findSubjectsBySlugs`, `upsertManySubjects` |
| `classes/seed-class-instances` | `ClassSessionService` | `upsertManyClassInstancesForSeed` |
| `classes/seed-subject-resources` | `ClassCatalogService` | `createManySubjectResources` |
| `meeting/seed-user-meeting-configs` | `MeetingConfigService` | `upsertManyUserMeetingConfigs` |

| `billing/seed-quotas` | `QuotaService`, `ClassCatalogService`, `RecurringClassService` | `seedOrGetQuotaBatch`, `findSubjectsBySlugs`, `upsertManyRecurringSchedules` |

### Avatar and logo helpers

- `lib/avatar-seed-helper.ts` — `seedAvatarForEntity`, `seedAvatarPool`, `linkAvatarsToEntities`
- `lib/logo-seed-helper.ts` — `seedCatalogLogoUrl` for meeting/payment/subject branding assets
- `lib/class-catalog-factory.ts` — canonical specs for books, categories, subjects, and subject-resource links
