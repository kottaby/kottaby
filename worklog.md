Task ID: 7.1-7.2
Agent: Orchestrator
Task: Phase 7 — post-implementation review waves + final gate

Work Log:
- R1: 3 parallel reviewers (backend/security/types) — zero critical/high/medium; 6 LOW fixed (converse coverage lock, exec bit, enum widenings, seed fallback, doc casing)
- R2: independent — 4 LOW adjudicated; R3: journey deep-dive — clean; R4: caught a type-erasing cast regression (sandbox restore had reverted the file) — fixed type-preservingly, tsgo 0
- Stop condition met (zero unadjudicated findings in 2 consecutive iterations) after 4 independent iterations
- Final gate: sub-loop exit 0 x14 files, tsgo 0, biome clean, all suites green (drift 19/0, plan 26/0, journey 13/0, session 66/0); full quality-gate OOMs in sandbox (lint-service SIGABRT, 4GB RAM) — per-file equivalent gate green
- Sandbox git-restore warfare countered via blob-level commits + pushes; remote feat branch verified at each step

Stage Summary:
- All 13 tasks [x]; 12+ outcome files; branch pushed to origin (remote-verified content)
- Plan COMPLETE per tasks.md + SKILL.md exit criteria

Task ID: session-start
Agent: Spec Implementation Orchestrator (paymob-gateway-integration)
Task: Session bootstrap for plan ai/plans/sprint_1/paymob-gateway-integration (per SKILL.md §Plan Intake)

Work Log:
- Cleaned sandbox workspace preserving Caddyfile; cloned kottaby/kottaby (main @ a63c0a7); branch feat/paymob-gateway-integration created (NEVER main)
- git identity: ahmedhosnypro <ahhosnyas@gmail.com>; gh 2.46.0 installed (local bin) + authenticated (repo scope)
- bun install (1260 pkgs); .env written (DB_PROVIDER=pglite, PGLITE_DATA_DIR=./db/pglite, sandbox secrets); .env.test + .env.test.ci (pglite, isolated ./db/pglite-test)
- bun db migrate: applied through 20260908103411_custom_4-student-payments-status-transition; bun db seed: OK (admin per ADMIN_EMAIL)
- Read SKILL.md in FULL (spec-implementation); plan intake: FULL-SPEC type (specs.md + plan.md + tasks.md); plan-review gate PASSED (outcome/plan-review-R1.md + R2.md); 20 open tasks across Phases 0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9; checkboxes all [ ] (no stale [-]); X.Y.QL/TE/SEC/SR/IV pipeline PRESENT in tasks.md; prototype/ dir present (16 screens) — prototype-aware UI implementation required; deferred-items.md exists (A-set A1-A6 coordination items)
- Prior session worklog (7.1-7.2) belongs to the completed session-report plan — non-blocking context only

Stage Summary:
- Environment ready: pglite embedded DB migrated+seeded, feature branch active, SKILL.md methodology loaded
- Next: Phase 0 baseline (task 0.1) via subagent

Task ID: 0.1
Agent: general-purpose subagent (resumed once after tool outage)
Task: Phase 0 baseline capture + seam verification

Work Log:
- Baselines (read-only): tsgo 0 errors / biome 0 warn 0 error (1775 files, NO --write) / lint full-repo success 105.9s (no OOM) / git clean except worklog.md. Evidence: /tmp/baseline-*
- Pass 1 died to a tool-session outage; pass 2 resumed from /tmp evidence (tsgo NOT re-run) and re-fixed HEAD reset to main (feat branch re-checked out; both @ a63c0a7)
- Seams: A1/A2/A3 pending in payment-gateway.types.ts (parseWebhookEvent(rawBody) non-null); factory+mock ok, resetPaymentGateway->resetEnvironmentCache (A5 free); webhook route bare-404/64_000-bound/masked-acks, processWebhookEvent(event, locale) at route :344-345; route-inventory :65 EXACT, sweep-sessions :61, static-assertions 17/0 (plan-review F7 RESOLVED); repo = 4 methods, NO findStalePendingByGateway (A4); no providerTransactionId column; activation failure path emits NO notification today (A6 baseline), success notification keyless; Paymob enum :13; env has zero paymob/ngrok keys; planCatalog :18 / purchaseSubscription :51 / mySubscriptions :42 / navItems :120 / withPageAuth :67-105 / bearerSecretMatches :66-73
- Citations specs section 1: 20 anchors -> 12 OK / 7 DRIFT (<=+22) / 1 MISSING - sibling plan archived to ai/finished_plans/ (pruned; prototype/ + deferred-items.md:45 gone); this plan's prototype/ (15 screens) is the live anchor
- Wrote outcome/0.1-outcome.md; flipped tasks.md 0.1 checkbox

Stage Summary:
- Phase 0 COMPLETE: baselines all-zero, A1-A6 seams confirmed pending-shaped, citation integrity verified (one archived-path finding, non-blocking)
- Next: task 2.1 (paymob env config); check feat branch + two custom_4 mirror dirs before migration 5
