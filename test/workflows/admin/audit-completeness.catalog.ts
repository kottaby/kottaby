/**
 * Admin action census — the machine-readable inventory of every shipped
 * admin-gated GraphQL mutation and the exact audit-trail shape its service
 * path is expected to mint.
 *
 * The census is the single typed source of truth that binds three surfaces
 * together:
 *  - the shipped admin mutation inventory under `backend/graphql/mutation/**`,
 *    bound bijectively (both directions) by the static census-drift test
 *    (`backend/db/test/logic/audit/audit-census-drift.test.ts`) so an
 *    unaudited admin mutation cannot ship without a census row, and a census
 *    row cannot outlive its mutation;
 *  - the append-only `audit_logs` trail, whose per-row shape (action type +
 *    entity type) each `wired` row pins — the mutation may map to more than
 *    one action type when its direction decides the verb (e.g. delete vs
 *    reactivate, suspend vs reactivate);
 *  - the audit-completeness journey, which executes every `wired` row through
 *    the real service path and asserts the minted rows against this shape.
 *
 * `deferred` rows name admin-action categories whose producer is NOT yet
 * shipped; each carries the ledger id of its owning deferred item so the gap
 * stays traceable to an owner. When such a surface ships, the drift test
 * fails until its row is replaced by a `wired` entry.
 *
 * The exhaustive `ACTION_TYPE_COVERAGE` map accounts for every
 * `AuditActionType` member: `"wired"` = shipped producer exists, `"fixture"`
 * = exercised by a System fixture lane in the completeness journey, and
 * `"deferred"` = producer still pending. Because the map is a total
 * `Record` over the enum, adding a new enum member fails to compile here
 * until it is accounted for.
