# Workflow / Journey Test Layer Rules

This directory contains **cross-actor journey tests**: sequential, multi-actor workflows executed
through the real service layer against the real test database.

## Hard rules

1. **NO `runInRollback` — ever.** Services use the global `db` and spawn their own top-level
   transactions; an outer rollback wrapper would deadlock or miss committed rows. This layer is
   the documented exception to the `backend/db/test/` rollback rule — valid only inside
   `test/workflows/`.
2. **Committed fixtures + tracked cleanup.** Create the full actor cast in `beforeAll` inside a
   committing `db.transaction(...)`. Track every created row id (including side-effect rows the
   services create) and hard-delete all of them in `afterAll`, in FK-safe order. Registration
   order IS the FK-safe deletion order (deletes run in reverse), and cleanup re-probes the
   database for EVERY registered row afterwards — teardown must leave ZERO residue, and those
   post-teardown existence checks are mandatory, not advisory (a leaking `afterAll` must fail
   the suite). Provision inside ONE committing transaction so setup is commit-or-nothing: a
   throwing `beforeAll` rolls back and leaves nothing behind.
3. **Unique UUID prefixes.** Every suite derives a per-run prefix
   (`` const prefix = `jrn_<domain>_${randomUUID().slice(0, 8)}` ``) used in names/notes so repeated
   or parallel runs never collide.
4. **Honest authorization only.** Actors are real users holding their real roles (`users.role` +
   role-child rows). Never monkey-patch role/permission resolution in a journey — negative steps
   must fail through the real authorization/ownership checks. Provision the cast with the
   `actor-context` factory — REAL `users` rows plus REAL role-child rows, never permission stubs.
5. **External effects always intercepted.** Nothing may reach real email/SMS/push/FX providers.
   Spy the notification dispatch boundary (namespace import + `spyOn` from `bun:test`; if
   interception empirically fails, fall back to `mock.module` and restore in `afterAll`). Assert
   both that a dispatch happened and **which userIds it targeted**. For services that take
   their transports / caches as INJECTED dependencies, install the spy at the injection seam —
   a spy is still a real dependency, just a recording one; side effects are SPIED, never sent.
6. **Never `expect(...).rejects.toThrow()`.** Use a try/catch helper and assert translated
   substrings from `getServerTranslations("en").errorsTranslations` — no hardcoded English strings.
7. **Use `bun:test` for test-framework imports.** Do not use Jest or Vitest; no `console.*`, no `any` casts.
8. **`@/` import aliases** (e.g. `@/test/workflows/helpers`), never relative parent paths.
9. **Never use demo/seeded rows as fixtures.** Always create your own entities via
   `backend/db/test/entity-setup.ts` helpers (`createTestUser`, `createTestStudent`,
   `createTestParent`, `createTestApplicant`, `createTestAdmin`) — verify signatures first; they
   vary.
10. **Organization**: one journey file per cross-actor workflow, grouped by domain subdirectory
    (`test/workflows/<domain>/<workflow>.test.ts`). Shared scaffolding lives in
    `test/workflows/helpers/` with a pure `export *` barrel (`./` paths only, one `/` max per
    export path).
11. **Sequential actor-attributed steps.** A journey is an ordered sequence of steps, each
    attributed to one named actor (or "System" for fixture setup); every service call receives
    that actor's real `actorUserId` from the actor-context factory. Steps run in declaration
    order — later steps observe the shared state that earlier steps committed.
12. **Cross-actor visibility + denial assertions.** Every journey asserts BOTH directions: the
    intended observer sees the change (row present / count flipped) AND every other cast
    member observes no accidental fan-out (foreign inboxes stay untouched), plus at least one
    denial probe — a non-owner's read/mutation attempt fails oracle-safely through the real
    authorization path while the owner's row remains byte-identical.

## Shared helpers (`test/workflows/helpers/`)

The helpers directory is the ONLY shared-scaffolding home for this layer. Import via the barrel:
`@/test/workflows/helpers`; its `index.ts` is a pure `export *` barrel (`./` paths only).

- **Registry helper** (`createSessionFixtureRegistry()` → `{ track, trackAll, ids, trackedCount,
  cleanup }`) — create ONE registry per suite. Every fixture row AND every row the services
  create during the journey must be registered via `track(<table>, id)`: the registry is the
  hard-delete worklist for `afterAll`. `cleanup()` hard-deletes all tracked ids inside ONE
  committed transaction in FK-safe order (children first, `users` last), then clears the
  registry; repeated calls are no-ops — safe under retries. Do NOT track trigger-immutable
  (DELETE-blocked) tables such as audit/transaction ledgers — journeys assert ZERO rows there
  instead, and a leak there is meant to fail the suite loudly.
- **`actor-context` factory** — `provisionStudentActor` / `provisionCertifiedTeacherActor` /
  `provisionParentActor` / `provisionAdminActor` (`(tx, { locale?, tracked? }) =>
  JourneyActor`). Each creates a REAL `users` row + its role-child row and returns
  `{ userId, locale, role }`; pass `{ tracked }` to auto-register both rows for teardown.
- **`SpiedFanoutTransport`** — in-process fan-out transport spy (structurally implements the
  fan-out transport port, so it installs wherever the engine accepts an injected transport).
  `publishFanout(userIds, payload)` records instead of delivering; assert via `calls`,
  `publishCount`, `lastCall`, `publishedUserIds`; `clear()` re-arms it between steps.
- **`helpers.self-test.test.ts`** — the harness self-test proving the contract above
  (registration → teardown → zero residue; publish-log replay; honest role provisioning).
  Keep it green and extend it whenever a helper gains new behavior.
- Side-effect absence is asserted by row-count deltas scoped to fixture ids (baseline before
  the step, unchanged after). Rule 5's dispatch spy still applies whenever a journey EXPECTS
  a dispatch.
- Idempotent-teardown proof: run the suite twice consecutively — a second green run proves
  zero residual state (per-run `jrn_<domain>_<8hex>` prefixes make collisions impossible;
  `cleanup` must leave nothing).

## Running

While iterating on one journey (log capture, AI-optimized output):

```bash
bun run test/scripts/run-test.ts test/workflows/<domain>/<workflow>.test.ts
```

The whole layer (via the approved runner):

```bash
bun run test/scripts/run-test.ts test/workflows
```
