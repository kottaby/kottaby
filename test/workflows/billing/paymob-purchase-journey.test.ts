/**
 * Cross-actor journey — student purchase through the real Paymob provider
 * branch → verified signed callback → activation workflow.
 *
 * Sequential, actor-attributed steps executed against the REAL services on
 * the REAL test database (later steps observe the shared state earlier
 * steps committed):
 *
 *   1. Student A purchases a plan with the paymob provider active → the
 *      intention is created over the provider's HTTP boundary (the only
 *      mocked hop) and ONE pending pair (subscription + payment) + junction
 *      row + verbatim-keyed claim commit, with the hosted-checkout
 *      descriptor surfaced.
 *   2. The signed settlement callback is delivered through the resolved
 *      callback channel (the factory's development default — no per-test
 *      tunnel logic) into the REAL webhook receiver → payment `paid` with
 *      the provider's transaction reference recorded, subscription
 *      `active` (endDate − startDate = intervalDays exactly), the plan's
 *      balance lane credited the full sessionCount, ONE payment-confirmation
 *      notification persisted, and the receipt published strictly
 *      post-commit — addressed to Student A ONLY.
 *   3. The SAME signed callback is re-delivered (byte-identical replay) →
 *      the receiver acks 200, the guarded transition answers a replay, and
 *      NOTHING moves again: no double credit, no second notification, no
 *      second publish, decided rows untouched.
 *   4. A delivery signed under the wrong secret is masked at the receiver
 *      with 401 BEFORE any parsing — zero state change.
 *   5. A body tampered after signing (flipped `success` flag, stale
 *      signature) is masked with 401 — zero state change.
 *   6. Student A purchases again and the provider fails the payment →
 *      `pending→failed` with the provider reference recorded, subscription
 *      stays pending, zero credit, and the FAILURE notification is
 *      persisted + published to Student A.
 *   7. Student B purchases (own key, own plan) and its own reference is
 *      delivered → B's payment settles and B's lane credits — while
 *      Student A's decided rows stay byte-identical and A's inbox does not
 *      grow (no cross-user fan-out).
 *   8. A verified-signature callback for Student A's pending pair carrying
 *      a DIFFERENT plan's amount is quarantined by the settlement check →
 *      ack `{ processed: false }`, Student A stays pending, zero credit,
 *      one bounded quarantine log.
 *
 * Journey rules honored (`test/workflows/AGENTS.md`):
 * - fixtures COMMITTED in `beforeAll` inside ONE committing transaction;
 *   never `runInRollback` (the services spawn their own top-level
 *   transactions);
 * - honest actors: real `users` rows + real role-child rows via the
 *   actor-context factory; every settlement flows through the REAL
 *   receiver gate and the REAL activation service — nothing monkey-patched;
 * - the provider's outbound HTTP is mocked at the ONE fetch boundary the
 *   gateway transport resolves to in production (the platform fetch the
 *   client's default transport delegates to); every other hop — signature
 *   gate, parse, guarded transition, credit, notification persist — runs
 *   the production code path;
 * - external effects intercepted at the notification boundary: the
 *   post-commit publish seam is SPIED (the activation service publishes
 *   post-commit through this exact namespace-bound seam; it exposes no
 *   injected-transport parameter);
 * - error assertions through typed route envelopes / logged codes — never
 *   `.rejects.toThrow()`;
 * - per-run `jrn_billing_<8hex>` prefix on every fixture name and
 *   idempotency key (the provider echoes the key back as the merchant
 *   order reference, so the prefix also isolates references per run);
 * - cross-actor visibility asserted BOTH directions plus denial probes.
 *
 * Immutable-ledger residue policy: `student_payments` rows are append-only
 * (BEFORE DELETE trigger) and a decided payment can never be edited or
 * removed through the guarded surface — but the rows ARE deletable under
 * the sanctioned teardown suspension (`withImmutabilityTriggersSuspended`),
 * which is exactly what `afterAll` does FIRST, followed by the junction
 * sweep, then the remaining legs via `TrackedFixtures` (reverse
 * registration order). Teardown must leave ZERO residue: every registered
 * row is re-probed after the sweep, and a leaking `afterAll` fails the
 * suite loudly.
