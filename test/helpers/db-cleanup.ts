/**
 * Targeted post-suite cleanup for live-wire GraphQL integration tests.
 *
 * Deletes `users` rows by EXPLICIT id list (never by email pattern — a
 * pattern sweep would also delete rows created by OTHER integration
 * suites running in parallel against the same database) together with
 * every row that would otherwise block or orphan the delete:
 *
 *  - `audit_logs` rows written BY the fixtures (`actor_id` FK RESTRICT)
 *    and rows ABOUT the fixtures (`entity_type = 'user'` +
 *    `entity_id` — no FK, but leaving them clutters the audit trail).
 *  - `subscriptions.user_id` + `evaluations.evaluator_id` — the two
 *    remaining RESTRICT FKs; defensive (this suite creates neither).
 *
 * Everything else (admin, teacher, wallet, teacher_verification,
 * parents, students, student_subscriptions, progress, applicants,
 * notifications, evaluations.evaluator_id targets) cascades from the
 * `users` delete via PostgreSQL FK actions.
 *
 * Suites that never hard-delete their own fixtures can assert
 * `deleted === ids.length` afterwards; `countUsersByIds` is provided
 * for the stronger "zero remain" self-check.
 *
 * TRIGGER AWARENESS (resolves QA 6-QA-4 P2-1): `bun db push`-provisioned
 * databases (the dev sandbox + `.env.test`) carry NO trigger on
 * `audit_logs`, so the DELETE below succeeds there directly.
 * Migrate-provisioned environments install the append-only immutability
 * trigger from `backend/db/migration/3-immutability-triggers.sql`
 * (`BEFORE DELETE` → RAISE EXCEPTION), which would make this helper
 * throw. The audit-row pre-clean therefore runs under
 * `withAuditDeleteTriggersSuspended`: every USER (non-internal) trigger
 * on `audit_logs` is discovered via `pg_trigger`, DISABLEd for the
 * duration of the DELETE, and restored to its EXACT prior firing state
 * (`tgenabled` O/D/R/A) in a `finally` block — a trigger that was
 * already disabled before cleanup stays disabled afterwards. Test-env
 * scoping: this path ONLY relaxes the immutability guard inside the
 * test-harness cleanup transaction window; production runtime code
 * never imports this helper.

/**
 * Generalized immutability-trigger suspension for APPEND-ONLY tables.
 *
 * `student_payments` and `teacher_transaction` carry the same append-only
 * immutability trigger family as `audit_logs` (BEFORE UPDATE/DELETE →
 * RAISE EXCEPTION, installed by the `3-immutability-triggers` migration),
 * and both restrict-delete their way into `students`/`wallet` — so a
 * journey teardown that tracked ledger rows (its own fixture payments and
 * payouts) cannot delete them through any FK-safe ordering without first
 * suspending the guards. This helper is the same sanctioned
 * disable→run→restore dance as {@link withAuditDeleteTriggersSuspended},
 * generalized by table:
 *
 *  - For EACH named table, every USER (non-internal) trigger is discovered
 *    via `pg_trigger` (resolved with `to_regclass`, so an unknown table
 *    simply discovers nothing) and its EXACT prior firing state
 *    (`tgenabled` O/D/R/A) is captured.
 *  - Every discovered trigger is DISABLEd (across all listed tables)
 *    before `fn` runs, and restored to its exact prior state in a
 *    `finally` block — a trigger that was already disabled before the
 *    suspension stays disabled afterwards. Discovery, disable, and
 *    restore are independent statements, so each phase runs via
 *    `Promise.all` (no await-in-loop).
 *  - When NO listed table carries user triggers (push-provisioned dev/test
 *    databases), `fn` runs directly with zero DDL round-trips.
 *  - Executes on the global `db` (no tx parameter) — journey teardown runs
 *    outside any rollback wrapper per `test/workflows/AGENTS.md` rule 1,
 *    exactly like the audit helper. This deliberately touches ONLY the
 *    named tables' non-internal triggers (never `session_replication_role`,
 *    which would also suspend referential-integrity triggers).
 *
 * Test-env scoping: this path ONLY relaxes the append-only guards inside
 * the test-harness teardown window; production runtime code never imports
 * this helper.
