  // The ALL-cohort broadcast fans one notifications row out per governed user
  // read from the SHARED test database. Parallel chaos/own-commit files keep
  // committed fixture users alive for their whole file and hard-delete them in
  // afterAll cleanup — when such a delete commits between the cohort read and
  // the batch insert, the FK check fails with 23503 (proved deterministically;
  // see PR #56 CI). Running this file alone after the pool drains closes the
  // race without touching the production read→write contract.
  // The admin-governance suite's `listAll` counts the WHOLE session table;
  // a concurrently-running own-commit fixture file (session-lifecycle chaos)
  // keeps committed session rows alive through its beforeAll/afterAll window,
  // so the total drifts by that many rows. Serializing it to the tail lane
  // (run alone, after the pool drains) restores a deterministic empty-table
  // baseline for the global count without changing the production read path.
  // The admin cold-start certification chaos suite provisions committed fixtures
  // and in afterAll calls deleteUsersByIds, which executes DDL
  // (`ALTER TABLE audit_logs DISABLE/ENABLE TRIGGER`). Running DDL against
  // audit_logs concurrently with other test workers creates table-level lock
  // and trigger state races against the immutable audit table. Serializing it
  // to the tail lane runs it alone after the worker pool drains.
