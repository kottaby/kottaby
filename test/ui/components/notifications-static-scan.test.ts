/**
 * Notifications views — REQ-028 static scan (tasks.md 4.3.TE).
 *
 * `frontend/views/notifications/**` renders notification content as TEXT
 * nodes through MUI `Typography` ONLY: emitter-provided copy is stored
 * verbatim (specs REQ-028 — the DB is plain varchar/text and the engine does
 * NOT sanitize HTML), so the XSS defense is structural —
 * `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is PROHIBITED anywhere in the notification view
 * tree. This suite scans every source file in the subtree and fails on any
 * occurrence (including comments, so a future docblock mention cannot
 * smuggle a real usage past the gate).
 *
 * Pure filesystem tier — no server, no DOM, no network.
