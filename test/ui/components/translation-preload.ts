/**
 * i18n + active-locale wiring — THIRD preload of `test:ui:components`.
 *
 * DIVERGENCE NOTE vs adopted `test/ui/AGENTS.md` (upstream target state):
 * AGENTS.md describes a `readTranslation(handle, locale)` Suspense cache from
 * `@/shared/locale/client/translation-cache-store`. That module does not exist
 * on this branch yet. Here the compile-time translation system loads EVERY
 * namespace SYNCHRONOUSLY via static imports — `getTranslations(locale)` in
 * `@/shared/locale/server.ts` is pure, in-memory and never suspends. So there
 * is nothing to async-preload; this file instead:
 *
 * 1. Warms ONLY the namespaces exercised by current component suites (landing
 *    + auth) for BOTH locales. Touching every label eagerly surfaces missing-
 *    key drift at PRELOAD time instead of deep inside a test assertion.
 * 2. Wires the ACTIVE-LOCALE source of truth used by client components that do
 *    NOT read `LocaleContext`: `frontend/hooks/useAppLocale` resolves the
 *    locale from Next.js route params (`useParams()`), and `LocaleSwitcher`
 *    drives switches through `useRouter().refresh()`. A `next/navigation`
 *    mock module is registered ONCE here with an in-memory state object that
 *    tests can point at `"ar"` or `"en"` before rendering — serverless, zero
 *    ports, zero network.
