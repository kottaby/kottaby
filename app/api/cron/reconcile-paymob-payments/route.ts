/**
 * Pending-payment reconciliation cron entry
 * (`GET /api/cron/reconcile-paymob-payments`).
 *
 * The externally-triggered sweep that heals payments whose settlement
 * callback never arrived: while the active gateway provider is paymob,
 * stuck `pending` payment rows are re-resolved by direct provider
 * inquiry — the same settlement decision the callback path would have
 * made — so a lost delivery cannot strand a purchase forever. The
 * callback receiver stays the primary settlement path (including the
 * provider's own callback retrial); this sweep only heals what retrial
 * could not.
 *
 * The endpoint is a thin shell over
 * `reconcilePendingPaymobPayments` and follows the externally-triggered
 * cron job rules the sessions sweeper established:
 *
 *  - **GET-only** — external schedulers inject
 *    `Authorization: Bearer ${CRON_SECRET}` on GET; Next.js answers every
 *    other verb with its own 405 for routes exporting only GET.
 *  - **Timing-safe bearer compare** against `CRON_SECRET`
 *    (`node:crypto.timingSafeEqual` over fixed-length SHA-256 digests —
 *    never a plain string compare, no length leak, no early exit); a
 *    missing/mismatched secret is a fail-closed 401 through the shared
 *    `UNAUTHORIZED` envelope. The secret is never accepted via query
 *    string.
 *  - **Mode gates fail closed** — the surface answers a BARE 404 unless
 *    BOTH `CRON_EXECUTION_MODE=external` AND
 *    `CRON_EXTERNAL_ENABLED=true`, exactly like the sessions sweeper: a
 *    deployment with externally-triggered jobs disabled exposes no cron
 *    endpoint at all.
 *  - **Provider configuration gate fails closed** — the reconciliation
 *    surface exists only while paymob is the ACTIVE provider AND the
 *    server-to-server API key (the reconciliation inquiry credential)
 *    is configured; anything else answers the SAME bare 404. Like the
 *    404 above, the response is deliberately NOT the shared error
 *    envelope: every envelope carries a `code`, and any code would tell
 *    the caller THIS path exists and is special — the oracle an
 *    unconfigured surface must never leak (a truly unknown path answers
 *    no envelope either). The gate re-reads the typed environment per
 *    request, so a mid-flight provider or key flip is honored on the
 *    very next run. The sweep itself gates identically — the route hides
 *    the endpoint, the service stays honest when invoked from anywhere
 *    else; both sides must agree before any work happens.
 *  - **Envelope** — success
 *    `{ data: { checked, confirmed, failed, skipped }, requestId }`
 *    through `apiSuccessResponse`: the honest per-run tally only, never
 *    row identities. The sweep never throws for provider or outcome
 *    content (unconfigured gates answer zero counts at the service
 *    level; per-row outcomes are counted), so the catch arm is reserved
 *    for true infrastructure breaches — masked through
 *    `apiErrorResponse` (500 `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`) — and the handler
 *    never lets an error escape raw.
 *
 * The route owns no reconciliation logic of its own: the batch bound,
 * the inquiry walk, and the settlement handoff belong to the service.
