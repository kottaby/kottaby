## Overview

Draft Academy is built by a **3-developer team** organized into **vertical tracer-bullet streams**. Each developer owns a complete vertical slice through every layer (schema, API, UI, tests) for their domain. Streams are designed to minimize cross-dependencies and blocking bottlenecks.

| **Student & Parent Experience** | Dev 1 | Registration, subscriptions, quotas, parent handshake, parent portal, Tajweed curriculum | `users`, `students`, `parents`, `subscriptions`, `student_subscriptions`, `plans`, `student_payments`, `progress`, `lessons` |
| **Teacher Lifecycle & Certification** | Dev 2 | Applicant registration, 5-session evaluation, cooldown, availability, session reports, homework | `users`, `teacher`, `applicants`, `teacher_verification`, `evaluations`, `reports`, `home_work`, `recitation` |

## Cross-Stream Interface Contracts

These are the shared contracts between streams. Each contract defines the interface boundary and the data that crosses it.

### Contract 1: Session Creation (Dev 1 → Dev 3)

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Provider** | Dev 1 (Student Experience) |
| **Consumer** | Dev 3 (Matching & Session Engine) |
| **Interface** | When a student requests a session, Dev 1's subscription/balance system validates the student has available session balance and decrements it (escrow hold). Dev 3's session engine creates the session record. |
| **Data Flow** | `student_id`, `teacher_id`, `intent` (hifz/tajweed), `session_type` (student_session), `fee` (from plan), `fee_held = true` |
| **Contract** | Dev 1 guarantees: student has `balance > 0` for the requested intent; balance is held (not decremented yet). Dev 3 guarantees: session record created with `fee_held = true`, `confirmation_deadline = now + 24h`. |
| **Decision Ref** | B.4 (escrow hold-at-request), B.3 (platform-set fees) |

### Contract 2: Teacher Availability (Dev 2 → Dev 3)

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Provider** | Dev 2 (Teacher Lifecycle) |
| **Consumer** | Dev 3 (Matching Engine) |
| **Interface** | Dev 3's matching algorithm queries Dev 2's teacher availability status to filter the directory. |
| **Data Flow** | `teacher.is_online`, `teacher.subjects`, `teacher.average_rating`, `teacher.request_preference` |
| **Contract** | Dev 2 guarantees: `is_online` is accurate within 15 minutes of last activity; in-session teachers have `is_online = false`. Dev 3 guarantees: only teachers with `is_online = true` and matching criteria appear in the directory. |
| **Decision Ref** | B.15 (15-min inactivity), B.16 (request_preference), A.6 (subjects) |

### Contract 3: Session Completion & Escrow (Dev 3 → Dev 1 & Dev 2)

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Provider** | Dev 3 (Session Engine & Escrow) |
| **Consumer** | Dev 1 (Student Balance) & Dev 2 (Session Reports) |
| **Interface** | Upon dual confirmation, Dev 3 triggers: (1) Dev 1 decrements the student's session balance, (2) Dev 2's session report is finalized, (3) Dev 3 credits the teacher's wallet. |
| **Data Flow** | `session.status = completed`, `session.confirmed_by_student_at`, `session.confirmed_by_teacher_at` |
| **Contract** | Dev 3 guarantees: dual confirmation verified before triggering balance decrement and wallet credit. Dev 1 guarantees: balance decremented atomically. Dev 2 guarantees: report and homework are submitted before completion. |
| **Decision Ref** | B.2 (24h timeout), B.4 (escrow decrement at completion) |

### Contract 4: Evaluation Sessions (Dev 2 → Dev 3)

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Provider** | Dev 2 (Teacher Lifecycle) |
| **Consumer** | Dev 3 (Session Engine) |
| **Interface** | Evaluation sessions use the same session table but with `session_type = teacher_evaluation`. Dev 2 manages the evaluation loop; Dev 3 provides the session infrastructure. |
| **Data Flow** | `session.session_type = 'teacher_evaluation'`, `session.intent = 'evaluation'`, `evaluations.evaluated_id`, `evaluations.evaluator_id` |
| **Contract** | Dev 2 guarantees: 5 distinct evaluators, ≥80% threshold logic. Dev 3 guarantees: session lifecycle works for evaluation sessions same as student sessions. |
| **Decision Ref** | A.8 (session_type), A.10 (session_intent), B.1 (80% threshold), C.3 (evaluated_id/evaluator_id) |

### Contract 5: Parent Notifications (Dev 3 → Dev 1)

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Provider** | Dev 3 (Notification Engine) |
| **Consumer** | Dev 1 (Parent Portal) |
| **Interface** | When a child's session completes, Dev 3's notification engine fires a notification to the linked parent. Dev 1's parent portal displays the notification. |
| **Data Flow** | `notifications.user_id = parent_id`, `notifications.type = 'session_completion'`, `notifications.related_entity_type = 'session'`, `notifications.related_entity_id = session.id` |
| **Contract** | Dev 3 guarantees: notification created when session reaches `completed` status and student has a linked parent. Dev 1 guarantees: parent portal displays notifications for linked children only. |
| **Decision Ref** | A.4 (notifications table) |

### Contract 6: Admin Operations (Dev 3 → Dev 1 & Dev 2)

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Provider** | Dev 3 (Admin Governance) |
| **Consumer** | Dev 1 (Student/Plan Management) & Dev 2 (Teacher/Evaluation Management) |
| **Interface** | Admin operations (cold-start bootstrapping, direct onboarding, subscription management, evaluation override) touch tables owned by Dev 1 and Dev 2. |
| **Data Flow** | Admin actions via Dev 3's admin endpoints → Dev 1's subscription/plan tables, Dev 2's teacher/evaluation tables |
| **Contract** | Dev 3 guarantees: all admin actions are logged in `audit_logs`. Dev 1 & Dev 2 guarantee: their tables accept admin-level mutations via the shared service layer. |
| **Decision Ref** | A.5 (audit_logs), B.9 (offline payment), B.17 (prorated plan changes) |

## Branching Strategy

### Branch Model

```
main (protected)
  ├── develop (integration branch)
  │     ├── dev1/sprint-N/feature-xxx   (Dev 1 feature branches)
  │     ├── dev2/sprint-N/feature-xxx   (Dev 2 feature branches)
  │     └── dev3/sprint-N/feature-xxx   (Dev 3 feature branches)
  └── release/vX.Y.Z                     (release branches)
```

### Rules

| Rule | Description |
|---|---|
| **`main` is protected** | No direct pushes. Only release merges via PR. |
| **`develop` is the integration branch** | All feature branches merge into `develop` via PR. |
| **Feature branch naming** | `dev{N}/sprint-{N}/{kebab-case-feature}` |
| **PR target** | All PRs target `develop`. Release PRs target `main`. |
| **Merge strategy** | Squash-and-merge for feature PRs. Merge-commit for release PRs. |

### PR Review Protocol

| Rule | Description |
|---|---|
| **Minimum reviewers** | 1 reviewer from a different stream |
| **Cross-stream review required** | If a PR touches a cross-stream interface contract, a reviewer from the affected stream must approve |
| **CI must be green** | All CI checks (lint, test, Mermaid validation) must pass |
| **Schema changes** | Any PR modifying `backend/db/schema/` requires review from all 3 developers |
| **Contract changes** | Any PR modifying a cross-stream interface contract requires explicit acknowledgment from all affected stream owners |

### Merge Conflict Prevention

| Strategy | Description |
|---|---|
| **Schema ownership** | Dev 1 owns migrations for student/parent/subscription tables. Dev 2 owns teacher/applicant/evaluation tables. Dev 3 owns session/wallet/notification/audit tables. Shared tables (`users`) require coordination. |
| **Interface-first development** | Define the interface contract before implementing. Both sides code to the contract. |
| **Daily integration** | Merge to `develop` at least once per day to catch conflicts early. |
| **Shared types** | Cross-stream shared types live in a shared module owned collectively. Changes require PR review from all streams. |
