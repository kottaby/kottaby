| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Owner Stream** | Dev 1 (Shared) |
| **Sprint** | 0 |
| **Story Points** | 5 |
| **Blocked By** | None — can start immediately |

**Description & Scope:**
Migrate the canonical `db/schema.dbml` to a runnable PostgreSQL migration. All 22 tables, 13 enums, and all relationships must be created. This is the foundation for all three streams.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given the db/schema.dbml file
When the migration is executed
Then all 22 tables are created with correct columns and types
And all 13 enums are created with correct values
And all foreign key relationships are established
And all check constraints are enforced
And all indexes are created
And the migration is reversible (down migration exists)
And `bun validate:dbml` passes
```

**Test Scenarios:**
- Migration up creates all tables without errors
- Migration down drops all tables without errors
- Re-running migration (up → down → up) is idempotent
- All unique constraints enforced (users.email, students.handshake_code, wallet.teacher_id)
- All check constraints enforced (balance >= 0, score 0-100, average_rating 0-5)

**Decision Refs:** All 33 decisions (schema is the ground truth)

### [DEV1-002] User Registration with Role-Specific Child Table Creation

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Owner Stream** | Dev 1 |
| **Sprint** | 0 |
| **Story Points** | 5 |
| **Blocked By** | DEV1-001 |

**Description & Scope:**
Implement user registration endpoint that creates a `users` record and the corresponding role-specific child table record (admin, teacher, students, parents, applicants) via shared PK inheritance. Include governance fields on `users` table (is_deleted, suspended, is_blocked, last_active_at).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given a new user wants to register
When they submit registration with name, email, phone, password, gender, country, and role
Then a users record is created with the specified role
And the corresponding child table record is created with shared PK
And governance fields are initialized (is_deleted=false, suspended=false, is_blocked=false)
And last_active_at is set to current timestamp
And email uniqueness is enforced
And password is hashed (not stored in plaintext)

Given a user registers as role=student
When registration completes
Then a students record is created with balance_hifz=0, balance_reviews=0, balance_tajweed=0
And a unique handshake_code is generated

Given a user registers as role=teacher
When registration completes
Then an applicants record is created (not teacher — teacher record only after verification)
And applicants.status = 'pending'

Given a user registers as role=parent
When registration completes
Then a parents record is created
```

**Test Scenarios:**
- Register with each role (admin, teacher, student, parent) — child table created
- Register with duplicate email — rejected with 409
- Register with missing required fields — rejected with 422
- Teacher registration creates applicants record, NOT teacher record (B.6/B.7)
- Student registration generates unique handshake_code (A.3)
- Password is hashed

**Decision Refs:** A.1 (parents table), A.7 (governance on users), B.6 (applicants table), B.7 (teacher after verification), C.1 (parent role)

### [DEV1-003] Recitation Selection on Registration

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Owner Stream** | Dev 1 |
| **Sprint** | 0 |
| **Story Points** | 2 |
| **Blocked By** | DEV1-002 |

**Description & Scope:**
Allow users to select their recitation reading (Qira'ah) during or after registration. The recitation is stored in the `recitation` table linked to the user. This is used by the matching algorithm (Dev 3) to filter teachers.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given a registered user
When they select their recitation reading (Qira'ah)
Then a recitation record is created linked to their user_id
And the recitation name is stored

Given a user with an existing recitation
When they add another recitation reading
Then a second recitation record is created (1:M relationship)
```

**Test Scenarios:**
- User can select recitation during registration
- User can add multiple recitation readings
- Recitation records are linked to user via session_id (C.5: 1:1 per session)

**Decision Refs:** C.5 (recitation 1:1 session — recitation table repurposed)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Owner Stream** | Dev 1 |
| **Sprint** | 0 |
| **Story Points** | 3 |
| **Blocked By** | DEV1-002 |

**Description & Scope:**
Credit new students with a free trial session upon registration. The trial session is credited to the appropriate balance field.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given a new student completes registration
When the student record is created
Then a free trial session is credited to their balance
And the trial session is tracked (can be in balance_hifz or a dedicated trial field)

Given a student with a free trial session
When they book their first session
Then the trial session balance is decremented
```

**Test Scenarios:**

### [DEV2-001] JWT Authentication Service

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Owner Stream** | Dev 2 (Shared) |
| **Sprint** | 0 |
| **Story Points** | 5 |
| **Blocked By** | DEV1-001 |

**Description & Scope:**
Implement JWT-based authentication: login endpoint, token issuance, token verification, and token refresh. Tokens include user role for RBAC.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given a registered user with correct credentials
When they submit login with email and password
Then a JWT token is issued containing user_id, role, and expiration
And the token is valid for the configured duration

Given a valid JWT token
When a request includes the token in the Authorization header
Then the token is verified and the user is authenticated

Given an expired JWT token
When a request includes the expired token
Then the request is rejected with 401

Given an invalid JWT token
When a request includes an invalid token
Then the request is rejected with 401
```

**Test Scenarios:**
- Login with correct credentials returns valid JWT
- Login with incorrect password returns 401

| **Owner Stream** | Dev 2 (Shared) |
| **Sprint** | 0 |
| **Story Points** | 3 |
| **Blocked By** | DEV2-001 |

**Description & Scope:**
Implement RBAC middleware that enforces role-based access control on all endpoints. Middleware checks the user's role from the JWT token and allows/denies access based on required role.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given a request with a valid JWT token
When the user's role matches the required role for the endpoint
Then the request is allowed through

Given a request with a valid JWT token
When the user's role does NOT match the required role
Then the request is rejected with 403

Given a request without a JWT token
When accessing a protected endpoint
Then the request is rejected with 401

Given an admin user
When accessing admin-only endpoints
Then access is granted

Given a student user
When accessing admin-only endpoints
Then access is denied with 403

Given a soft-deleted user (is_deleted=true)
When attempting to access any endpoint
Then access is denied with 403
```

**Test Scenarios:**
- Admin can access admin endpoints
- Teacher cannot access admin endpoints
- Student cannot access teacher endpoints
- Parent can access parent-only endpoints
- Soft-deleted user is denied access
- Blocked user is denied access
- Suspended user is denied access to session creation

**Decision Refs:** A.7 (governance fields on users), C.1 (parent role)

```gherkin
Given the shared types module
When any stream imports types
Then all cross-stream data structures are typed
And the interface contracts from TEAM_ALLOCATION.md are encoded as TypeScript interfaces
And the types are validated at compile time
```

**Test Scenarios:**
- All shared types compile without errors
- Cross-stream contracts match the documented interfaces
- Type changes require PR review from all streams

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Owner Stream** | Dev 3 (Shared) |
| **Sprint** | 0 |
| **Story Points** | 3 |
| **Blocked By** | None — can start immediately |

**Description & Scope:**
Implement shared error handling middleware and standardized API response format. All streams use the same error codes and response structure.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given any API endpoint
When an error occurs
Then the response follows the standardized error format with code, message, and details
And HTTP status codes are consistent (200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404, 409, 422, 500)
And validation errors include field-level details
```

**Test Scenarios:**

Set up the API gateway and routing skeleton that all streams will use. Include health check endpoints, route registration, and middleware chain (auth → RBAC → handler).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given the API gateway is running
When a health check request is sent
Then a 200 OK response is returned with status information

Given a route is registered by any stream
When a request matches the route
Then the middleware chain is executed (auth → RBAC → handler)
And the response is returned in standardized format
```

**Test Scenarios:**
- Health check returns 200
- Unknown route returns 404
- Middleware chain executes in correct order
- Route registration works for all streams

### [DEV1-005] Plan Catalog CRUD (Admin Only)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Owner Stream** | Dev 1 |
| **Sprint** | 1 |
| **Story Points** | 3 |
| **Blocked By** | DEV1-002 |

**Description & Scope:**
Implement admin-only CRUD for the plan catalog. Admin can create, edit, activate, and deactivate all subscription plan types (Hifz Jadid, Muraja'ah, Tathbeet, Atfal, Mukathaf, Tajweed, Teacher Verification).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given an authenticated admin
When they create a plan with title, session_count, price, currency, interval_days
Then the plan is created in the plans table
And session_count > 0 is enforced
And price >= 0 is enforced
And interval_days > 0 is enforced

Given an existing plan
When the admin edits the plan
Then the plan is updated

Given an existing plan
When the admin deactivates a plan
Then the plan is no longer visible to students for purchase
But existing subscriptions to the plan remain active

Given a non-admin user
When they attempt to access plan CRUD endpoints
Then access is denied with 403
```

**Test Scenarios:**
- Admin creates plan with valid data — 201 Created
- Admin creates plan with session_count=0 — 422 Validation error
- Admin creates plan with price=-1 — 422 Validation error
- Non-admin attempts plan CRUD — 403 Forbidden
- Deactivated plan not shown to students
- Existing subscriptions remain active after deactivation

**Decision Refs:** FR-2.1, FR-2.2, FR-2.3

### [DEV1-006] Subscription Purchase via Payment Gateway

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Owner Stream** | Dev 1 |
| **Sprint** | 1 |
| **Story Points** | 5 |
| **Blocked By** | DEV1-005 |

**Description & Scope:**
Implement subscription purchase flow: student selects a plan, pays via payment gateway, subscription is created with status=pending, payment is recorded, and upon payment confirmation, subscription status changes to active and session balance is credited.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given an authenticated student
When they purchase a plan via payment gateway
Then a student_payments record is created with status=pending
And a subscriptions record is created with status=pending
And the payment gateway processes the payment

Given a payment is confirmed by the gateway
When the webhook/callback is received
Then student_payments.status changes to paid
And subscriptions.status changes to active
And subscriptions.start_date and end_date are set based on interval_days
And the full session_count is credited to the respective balance

Given a payment fails
When the webhook/callback is received
Then student_payments.status changes to failed
And subscriptions.status remains pending

Given a student with an active subscription
When they attempt to purchase the same plan again
Then a new subscription period is created (renewal)
```

**Test Scenarios:**
- Student purchases plan — payment pending → paid → subscription active
- Payment fails — subscription stays pending
- Subscription activation credits correct balance (Hifz → balance_hifz, Tajweed → balance_tajweed)
- Subscription start_date and end_date set correctly
- Duplicate purchase creates renewal subscription

**Decision Refs:** A.9 (subscription status), B.8/C.2 (user_id generic), FR-2.4, FR-2.5

### [DEV1-007] Segregated Session Balance Crediting

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Owner Stream** | Dev 1 |
| **Sprint** | 1 |
| **Story Points** | 5 |
| **Blocked By** | DEV1-006 |

**Description & Scope:**
Implement segregated session balance crediting logic. When a subscription is activated, the full session_count is credited to the respective balance (balance_hifz, balance_tajweed, or balance_reviews) based on the plan type. Balances are non-negative integers.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given a student purchases a Hifz plan with session_count=8
When the subscription is activated
Then students.balance_hifz is incremented by 8
And students.balance_tajweed and balance_reviews are unchanged

Given a student purchases a Tajweed plan with session_count=12
When the subscription is activated
Then students.balance_tajweed is incremented by 12

Given a student with balance_hifz=4
When they attend a Hifz session (dual confirmation)
Then balance_hifz is decremented by 1 to 3

Given a student with balance_hifz=0
When they attempt to request a Hifz session
Then the request is rejected with 422 "Insufficient balance"
```

**Test Scenarios:**
- Hifz plan credits balance_hifz only
- Tajweed plan credits balance_tajweed only
- Review plan credits balance_reviews only
- Balance decrement on session completion
- Insufficient balance prevents session request
- Balance cannot go negative (check constraint)

**Decision Refs:** FR-2.5, INV-B1, INV-B2, INV-B4, INV-B5

### [DEV1-008] Subscription Validity Window & Expiry

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Owner Stream** | Dev 1 |
| **Sprint** | 1 |
| **Story Points** | 3 |
| **Blocked By** | DEV1-007 |

**Description & Scope:**
Implement subscription validity window: set start_date and end_date based on interval_days. Unused sessions expire at the end of the interval with no carryover. A background job checks for expired subscriptions and sets status=expired.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given a subscription is activated with interval_days=30
When the subscription start_date is set
Then end_date = start_date + 30 days

Given a subscription past its end_date
When the expiry job runs
Then subscriptions.status is set to expired
And any remaining session balance for that subscription period is zeroed

Given a student with an expired subscription
When they attempt to request a session
Then the request is rejected with 422 "Subscription expired"

Given a subscription within its validity window
When the student checks their balance
Then the balance reflects sessions remaining in the current period
```

**Test Scenarios:**
- Subscription end_date = start_date + interval_days
- Expired subscription → status=expired, balance zeroed
- Active subscription → balance available
- No carryover of unused sessions to next period
- Expiry job correctly identifies and expires subscriptions

**Decision Refs:** FR-2.4, INV-B3, INV-B6

### [DEV1-009] Admin Subscription Management (Extend/Renew/Cancel/Upgrade/Downgrade)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Owner Stream** | Dev 1 |
| **Sprint** | 1 |
| **Story Points** | 5 |
| **Blocked By** | DEV1-008 |

**Description & Scope:**
Implement admin subscription management: extend validity window, renew subscription, cancel subscription, and upgrade/downgrade with prorated balance handling.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given an admin and an active subscription
When the admin extends the validity window
Then subscriptions.end_date is extended
And the action is logged in audit_logs

Given an admin and an expired subscription
When the admin renews the subscription
Then a new subscription period is created with fresh session credits

Given an admin and an active subscription
When the admin cancels the subscription
Then subscriptions.status is set to cancelled
And remaining balance is preserved (not zeroed)

Given a student with an active subscription (Hifz, 4 sessions remaining)
When the admin upgrades the plan to a larger Hifz plan
Then the remaining 4 sessions are prorated (value credited toward new plan)
And a new subscription is created with the new plan's session_count
And the validity window resets to the new plan's interval_days

Given a student with an active subscription (Hifz, 8 sessions remaining)
When the admin downgrades to a smaller Hifz plan
Then the remaining 8 sessions are prorated (excess value forfeited)
And a new subscription is created with the new plan's session_count
```

**Test Scenarios:**
- Admin extends subscription — end_date updated, audit logged
- Admin renews expired subscription — new period created
- Admin cancels subscription — status=cancelled, balance preserved
- Admin upgrades plan — prorated balance, new interval
- Admin downgrades plan — prorated balance, new interval
- Non-admin attempts subscription management — 403

**Decision Refs:** B.17 (prorated plan changes), FR-2.7, A.5 (audit logging)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Owner Stream** | Dev 2 |
| **Sprint** | 1 |
| **Story Points** | 3 |
| **Blocked By** | DEV2-002 |

**Description & Scope:**
Implement teacher applicant registration flow. When a user registers as role=teacher, an applicants record is created (NOT a teacher record). The applicants table tracks verification_attempts, last_attempt_at, cooldown_until, and status.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given a new user registers as role=teacher
When registration completes
Then an applicants record is created with status='pending'
And verification_attempts=0
And cooldown_until is null
And NO teacher record is created (teacher record only after passing verification)

Given an applicant with status='pending'
When they view their profile
Then they see their applicant status, not teacher status

Given an applicant who failed evaluation
When their cooldown expires
Then they can re-purchase the verification plan
And verification_attempts is incremented
And last_attempt_at is updated
```

**Test Scenarios:**
- New teacher registration creates applicants record, not teacher record
- Applicants status starts as 'pending'
- Failed applicant has cooldown_until set
- Re-application after cooldown increments verification_attempts
- Teacher record is NOT created until verification passes

**Decision Refs:** B.6 (applicants table), B.7 (teacher record after verification), FR-3.1

### [DEV2-005] Verification Plan Purchase (5 Sessions)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Owner Stream** | Dev 2 |
| **Sprint** | 1 |
| **Story Points** | 3 |
| **Blocked By** | DEV2-004, DEV1-006 |

**Description & Scope:**
Implement verification plan purchase for teacher applicants. The verification plan is a specialized plan with session_count=5. Upon purchase, 5 evaluation session credits are available. Uses the same subscription/payment infrastructure as student plans (subscriptions.user_id is generic).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given a teacher applicant with status='pending'
When they purchase the "New Teacher Verification & Evaluation Plan"
Then a subscriptions record is created with user_id = applicant's user_id
And the subscription is linked to the verification plan (session_count=5)
And payment is processed via student_payments
And applicants.status changes to 'in_evaluation'

Given an applicant in cooldown
When they attempt to purchase the verification plan
Then the purchase is rejected with 422 "Cooldown active until {cooldown_until}"

Given an applicant's cooldown has expired
When they purchase the verification plan
Then the purchase is allowed
And verification_attempts is incremented
```

**Test Scenarios:**
- Applicant purchases verification plan — subscription created, status=in_evaluation
- Applicant in cooldown — purchase rejected
- Applicant after cooldown — purchase allowed, attempts incremented
- Verification plan has exactly 5 sessions

**Decision Refs:** B.8/C.2 (user_id generic), FR-3.2, FR-3.3

### [DEV2-006] 5-Session Evaluation Loop Booking

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Owner Stream** | Dev 2 |
| **Sprint** | 1 |
| **Story Points** | 5 |
| **Blocked By** | DEV2-005 |

**Description & Scope:**
Implement the 5-session evaluation loop. The applicant must book 5 evaluation sessions with 5 distinct certified Shuyukh. Each session has session_type=teacher_evaluation and intent=evaluation. The system enforces that no evaluator evaluates the same applicant twice.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given an applicant with an active verification subscription
When they book an evaluation session
Then a session record is created with session_type='teacher_evaluation'
And session.intent = 'evaluation'
And the evaluator (teacher) must have is_approved=true AND is_evaluator=true

Given an applicant who has completed 3 evaluation sessions with 3 distinct evaluators
When they book the 4th session
Then the system prevents booking with any of the 3 previous evaluators
And only shows available certified evaluators not yet used

Given an applicant who has completed 5 evaluation sessions
When they attempt to book a 6th evaluation session
Then the request is rejected with 422 "Evaluation loop complete"

Given an applicant with 0 remaining evaluation credits
When they attempt to book an evaluation session
Then the request is rejected with 422 "No evaluation sessions remaining"
```

**Test Scenarios:**
- Book evaluation session with certified evaluator — session created
- Attempt to book with same evaluator twice — rejected
- 5th session completes the loop — 6th rejected
- No remaining credits — booking rejected
- Evaluator must be is_approved=true AND is_evaluator=true

**Decision Refs:** A.8 (session_type), A.10 (session_intent), INV-TV2 (5 distinct evaluators), FR-3.3

### [DEV2-007] Evaluation Rubric Scoring (≥80% Threshold)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Owner Stream** | Dev 2 |
| **Sprint** | 1 |
| **Story Points** | 5 |
| **Blocked By** | DEV2-006 |

**Description & Scope:**
Implement evaluation rubric scoring. Each evaluator submits an evaluation with score (0-100), notes, and pass/fail. The system aggregates 5 evaluation results and applies the ≥80% pass threshold. If the applicant meets the threshold, teacher.is_approved is set to true and a teacher record is created.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given an evaluator completing an evaluation session
When they submit the evaluation
Then an evaluations record is created with evaluated_id=applicant, evaluator_id=sheikh
And evaluations.score is 0-100 (check constraint)
And evaluations.notes contains qualitative observations

Given 5 evaluation sessions are complete
When the system aggregates results
Then if the applicant scored >= 80 on all 5 evaluations, they PASS
And if the applicant scored < 80 on any evaluation, they FAIL
And the primary failure area (Tajweed or Hifz) is identified

Given an applicant who passed (all 5 >= 80)
When the aggregation completes
Then a teacher record is created (shared PK with users)
And teacher.is_approved = true
And applicants.status = 'passed'
And the applicant gains full teaching permissions

Given an applicant who failed
When the aggregation completes
Then applicants.status = 'failed'
And the applicant enters cooldown (1-month Tajweed or 3-month Hifz)
And a students record is created for the failed applicant
```

**Test Scenarios:**
- All 5 scores >= 80 — pass, teacher record created
- One score < 80 — fail, cooldown assigned
- Score of exactly 80 — pass (boundary)
- Score of 79 — fail (boundary)
- Primary failure is Tajweed — 1-month cooldown
- Primary failure is Hifz — 3-month cooldown
- Failed applicant gets students record
- Evaluations record has evaluated_id and evaluator_id (C.3)

**Decision Refs:** B.1 (80% threshold), B.7 (teacher record after verification), C.3 (evaluated_id/evaluator_id), INV-E1, FR-3.5, FR-3.6

### [DEV2-008] Cooldown State Machine (1-Month Tajweed / 3-Month Hifz)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Owner Stream** | Dev 2 |
| **Sprint** | 1 |
| **Story Points** | 5 |
| **Blocked By** | DEV2-007 |

**Description & Scope:**
Implement the cooldown state machine. Failed applicants are assigned a cooldown period: 1 month (30 days) for Tajweed weakness, 3 months (90 days) for Hifz weakness. During cooldown, the applicant is suspended and cannot re-purchase the verification plan. After cooldown, they can re-apply.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given an applicant who failed with major Tajweed weakness
When the failure is recorded
Then users.suspended = true
And users.suspended_at = current timestamp
And users.suspended_period_days = 30
And applicants.cooldown_until = now + 30 days
And applicants.status = 'failed'

Given an applicant who failed with major Hifz weakness
When the failure is recorded
Then users.suspended_period_days = 90
And applicants.cooldown_until = now + 90 days

Given an applicant in cooldown
When they attempt to purchase the verification plan
Then the purchase is rejected with 422 "Cooldown active"

Given an applicant whose cooldown has expired
When they check their status
Then users.suspended = false (reactivated)
And they can re-purchase the verification plan

Given a failed applicant
When they are converted to a student
Then a students record is created
And they can subscribe to plans and attend sessions during cooldown
```

**Test Scenarios:**
- Tajweed failure — 30-day cooldown
- Hifz failure — 90-day cooldown
- Cooldown active — verification plan purchase rejected
- Cooldown expired — re-application allowed

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Owner Stream** | Dev 2 |
| **Sprint** | 1 |
| **Story Points** | 3 |
| **Blocked By** | DEV2-008 |

**Description & Scope:**
When an applicant fails evaluation, create a students record for them so they can subscribe to plans and attend sessions during their cooldown period. The applicant retains their applicants record for re-evaluation tracking.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given an applicant who failed evaluation
When the failure is recorded
Then a students record is created (shared PK with users)
And students.balance_hifz = 0, balance_tajweed = 0, balance_reviews = 0
And a unique handshake_code is generated for the student record
And the applicants record is preserved (not deleted)

Given a failed applicant with a students record
When they subscribe to a plan during cooldown
Then the subscription works normally
And they can attend sessions

Given a failed applicant who later passes re-evaluation
When they are certified
Then their teacher record is created
And their students record is preserved (historical data)
```

**Test Scenarios:**
- Failed applicant gets students record
- Students record has zeroed balances
- Handshake code generated for student record
- Applicants record preserved
- Failed applicant can subscribe and attend sessions
- Re-certified applicant has both teacher and student records

Then teacher.is_approved = true
And a teacher record is created
And the action is logged in audit_logs with action_type='override'

Given an admin and an applicant who passed automated evaluation
When the admin manually rejects the applicant
Then the applicant enters cooldown
And the action is logged in audit_logs

Given an admin and an applicant
When the admin grants re-evaluation
Then the applicant can re-purchase the verification plan without waiting for cooldown
And the action is logged in audit_logs
```

**Test Scenarios:**
- Admin certifies failed applicant — teacher record created, audit logged
- Admin rejects passed applicant — cooldown assigned, audit logged
- Admin grants re-evaluation — cooldown bypassed, audit logged
- Non-admin attempts override — 403 Forbidden
- All override actions are in audit_logs

| **Story Points** | 5 |
| **Blocked By** | DEV3-006 |

**Description & Scope:**
Implement the teacher's session report submission flow. At the end of every completed session, the teacher submits a report with performance notes, homework assignments (Jadid: new memorization, Madi: review), and a numerical grade. The first session is diagnostic (no prior homework to evaluate).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given a teacher completing a session
When they submit the session report
Then a reports record is created with teacher_notes and student_rating_by_teacher
And a home_work record is created with:
  | current_from_ayah | current_to_ayah | current_grade | current_surah_juz | (Jadid)
  | revision_from_ayah | revision_to_ayah | revision_grade | revision_surah_juz | (Madi)

Given the first session with a student
When the teacher submits the report
Then homework is assigned (not graded) — no prior homework to evaluate (INV-HW3)

Given a subsequent session
When the teacher submits the report
Then the previous session's homework is graded
And new homework is assigned for the next session (INV-HW4)

Given a teacher viewing a student's homework
When the student has sessions with different teachers
Then all homework assignments are visible (cross-teacher continuity)
```

**Test Scenarios:**
- Report submitted with homework — both Jadid and Madi fields populated
- First session — homework assigned, not graded
- Subsequent session — previous homework graded, new homework assigned
- Cross-teacher homework visibility — all assignments visible
- Grades outside 0-100 — rejected

**Description & Scope:**
Implement Surah/Juz enum-based homework tracking. Homework uses the surah_juz_ref enum for current_surah_juz and revision_surah_juz. This allows non-contiguous review assignments (e.g., "Surah Al-Baqarah" or "Juz 30").

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given a teacher assigning homework
When they select a Surah or Juz
Then the surah_juz_ref enum value is stored in current_surah_juz or revision_surah_juz
And the enum value is validated against the surah_juz_ref enum

Given homework with Surah Al-Baqarah
When the teacher assigns revision homework for Juz 30
Then both current_surah_juz and revision_surah_juz can be different values
And non-contiguous assignments are supported
```

**Test Scenarios:**
- Valid Surah enum value — accepted
- Valid Juz enum value — accepted
- Non-contiguous assignments — both fields can differ
- Invalid enum value — rejected

Implement the on-demand matching algorithm. Students browse available teachers filtered by: (1) Qira'ah match, (2) subject availability, (3) country priority, (4) language match, (5) rating ranking. Only teachers with is_online=true and is_approved=true appear. In-session teachers are excluded.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given a student browsing available teachers
When the matching algorithm runs
Then only teachers with is_online=true AND is_approved=true are returned
And teachers are filtered by the student's recitation (Qira'ah) — Priority 1
And teachers are filtered by subject availability matching the student's intent — Priority 2
And teachers in the student's country are prioritized — Priority 3
And teachers fluent in the student's language are filtered for non-Arabic speakers — Priority 4
And teachers are sorted by average_rating descending — Priority 5

Given a student in Egypt with intent=Hifz and recitation=Hafs
When they browse teachers
Then Hafs-certified teachers in Egypt with Hifz subject appear first
And Hafs-certified teachers in other countries appear next
And non-Hafs teachers are excluded
And teachers without Hifz subject are excluded

Given a non-Arabic-speaking student
When they browse teachers
Then only teachers fluent in the student's language are shown

Given no teachers match all criteria
When the student browses
Then an empty result is returned with a message "No teachers available"
```

**Test Scenarios:**
- All filters applied correctly (Qira'ah, subject, country, language, rating)
- Country priority — same country first, fallback to others
- Rating sort — descending order
- No matches — empty result
- In-session teachers excluded
- Non-certified teachers excluded
- Unavailable teachers excluded

| **Blocked By** | DEV3-012, DEV1-007 |

**Description & Scope:**
Implement the fee escrow model. When a session is requested, the fee is held (fee_held=true, balance held but not decremented). Upon dual confirmation, the balance is decremented and the teacher's wallet is credited. If cancelled, held funds are released back.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given a student requests a session
When the session is created
Then session.fee is set by the platform (B.3)
And session.fee_held = true (B.4)
And the student's balance is held (not decremented yet)

Given a session with fee_held=true
When dual confirmation completes
Then the student's balance is decremented by 1
And session.fee_held is set to false
And the teacher's wallet is credited with session.fee

Given a session with fee_held=true
When the session is cancelled
Then session.fee_held is set to false
And the held balance is released (no decrement)
And no wallet transaction is created

Given a student with insufficient balance
When they request a session
Then the request is rejected with 422 "Insufficient balance"
And no session is created
```

**Test Scenarios:**
- Session request — fee held, balance held (not decremented)
- Dual confirmation — balance decremented, wallet credited, fee_held=false
- Cancellation — fee released, no decrement, no wallet credit
- Insufficient balance — request rejected
- Fee is platform-set (B.3), not negotiated

| **Story Points** | 5 |
| **Blocked By** | DEV3-013 |

**Description & Scope:**
Implement teacher wallet crediting. Upon dual confirmation, a teacher_transaction (type=earning) is created, crediting the session fee to the teacher's wallet. Wallet balance and total_earning are updated. Each teacher has exactly one wallet.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given a session with dual confirmation complete
When the wallet crediting runs
Then a teacher_transaction record is created with type='earning'
And teacher_transaction.wallet_id = teacher's wallet
And teacher_transaction.session_id = session.id
And teacher_transaction.amount = session.fee
And teacher_transaction.status = 'completed'
And wallet.balance is incremented by session.fee
And wallet.total_earning is incremented by session.fee

Given a teacher without a wallet
When the first earning transaction is attempted
Then a wallet record is created for the teacher
And the earning transaction is linked to the new wallet

Given a cancelled session
When the wallet crediting is checked
Then NO teacher_transaction is created (no earning for cancelled sessions)
```

**Test Scenarios:**
- Dual confirmation — earning transaction created, wallet credited
- Wallet balance and total_earning updated correctly
- Cancelled session — no earning transaction
- Teacher without wallet — wallet created on first earning
- Wallet balance >= 0 (check constraint)
- Transaction amount >= 0 (check constraint)

**Description & Scope:**
Implement teacher withdrawal workflow. Teachers can request withdrawals from their wallet. Withdrawal requests start as pending and transition to completed (admin approves) or failed (admin rejects). Financial records are immutable.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given a teacher with wallet.balance > 0
When they request a withdrawal
Then a teacher_transaction is created with type='withdrawal', status='pending'
And the transaction amount is validated against wallet.balance

Given a pending withdrawal request
When the admin approves it
Then teacher_transaction.status changes to 'completed'
And wallet.balance is decremented by the withdrawal amount

Given a pending withdrawal request
When the admin rejects it
Then teacher_transaction.status changes to 'failed'
And wallet.balance is NOT decremented

Given a withdrawal request for more than wallet.balance
When the teacher submits it
Then the request is rejected with 422 "Insufficient wallet balance"

Given a completed or failed withdrawal transaction
When any attempt is made to modify it
Then the attempt is rejected (INV-W6: financial immutability)
```

**Test Scenarios:**
- Teacher requests withdrawal — pending transaction created
- Admin approves — completed, balance decremented
- Admin rejects — failed, balance unchanged
- Withdrawal > balance — rejected
- Attempt to modify completed transaction — rejected (immutable)
- Attempt to modify failed transaction — rejected (immutable)

Implement the parent-child link request workflow. A parent searches for their child using the handshake code and sends a link request. The student must explicitly confirm within 7 days. After 7 days, the link request expires.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given a parent with the child's handshake code
When they search for the child
Then the student is found (by handshake_code)
And the parent can send a link request

Given a parent sends a link request
When the request is created
Then students.parent_id is set to the parent's user_id (pending)
And the link request has a 7-day expiry
And the student is notified to confirm

Given a pending link request
When the student confirms within 7 days
Then the link is established
And students.parent_id is confirmed
And the parent gains read-only monitoring access

Given a pending link request
When 7 days pass without student confirmation
Then the link request expires
And students.parent_id is cleared (set to null)
And the parent must re-initiate the link request

Given a student with an existing parent link
When another parent attempts to link
Then the attempt is rejected (B.12: one parent per student)
```

**Test Scenarios:**
- Parent searches by code — student found
- Link request sent — student notified
- Student confirms within 7 days — link established
- Link request expires after 7 days — parent_id cleared
- Second parent attempts link — rejected (one parent per student)
- Parent can link to multiple children (different students, same parent_id)

  | action_type = the action type (audit_action_type enum)
  | entity_type = the affected entity type
  | entity_id = the affected entity ID
  | details = JSON with action details
  | created_at = current timestamp

Given an audit log record
When any attempt is made to modify or delete it
Then the attempt is rejected (append-only, immutable)

Given an admin
When they review the audit trail
Then they can filter by actor_id, action_type, entity_type, entity_id, and date range
And the results show all administrative actions in chronological order
```

**Test Scenarios:**

Then they see wallet.balance, wallet.total_earning, and all teacher_transactions
And they can filter transactions by type, status, and date

Given an admin and a pending withdrawal request
When they approve it
Then teacher_transaction.status = 'completed'
And wallet.balance is decremented
And the action is logged in audit_logs

Given an admin and a pending withdrawal request
When they reject it
Then teacher_transaction.status = 'failed'
And wallet.balance is NOT decremented
And the action is logged in audit_logs

Given an admin
When they issue a manual wallet adjustment (bonus)
Then a teacher_transaction is created with type='bonus'
And wallet.balance is adjusted (credit or deduction)
And the action is logged in audit_logs with action_type='adjust'
```

**Test Scenarios:**
- Admin audits payments — all payments visible with filters
- Admin inspects wallet — balance, earnings, transactions visible
- Admin approves withdrawal — completed, balance decremented, audit logged
- Admin rejects withdrawal — failed, balance unchanged, audit logged
- Admin issues bonus — transaction created, balance adjusted, audit logged
- Non-admin — 403
