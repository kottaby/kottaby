# Authentication Architecture & Redirect Loop Fix

## Overview

This document describes the authentication architecture in Kottaby, explains the infinite redirect loop bug between `/login` and `/dashboard`, and documents the fix strategy.

## Current Auth Architecture

### Token Types

| Token | Storage | Lifetime | Purpose |
|-------|---------|----------|---------|
| `access_token` | **React memory only** (not a cookie) | Short-lived (~15min) | GraphQL API authorization header |
| `refresh_token` | **httpOnly cookie** | 7 days | Silent token rotation via GraphQL mutation |
| `session_id` | **httpOnly cookie** | 7 days | Server-side session validation |

### Auth Flow (Current)

```

### The Infinite Redirect Loop

**Original loop (fixed)**: The server-side `getServerUserContext()` required an `access_token` cookie that was never set by the auth flow, while the client authenticated successfully via `refreshToken` → client/server desync ping-pong between `/login` and `/dashboard`. Fixed by the session-only SSR fallback (below) and the `app/(auth)/layout.tsx` bounce guard.

**Current loop (post-M6)**: With the session-only fallback in place, symmetric desync can still occur on the refresh path itself:

```
/dashboard (Client)
  └─ me / notificationAlerts → UNAUTHENTICATED (no/expired access token)
  └─ errorLink → refreshToken mutation
       └─ session_id valid ✅, but refresh_token cookie JTI is STALE
          (racing tabs both rotated tokens; one cookie is out of date)
       └─ validateRefreshTokenJti: logs "allowing rotation" but
          jtiMatchesSession returns false → resolver returns null
  └─ Client: "refresh failed — redirecting to /login"
       │
/login (Server SSR)
  └─ getServerUserContext() → session_id valid → session-only auth ✅
  └─ app/(auth)/layout.tsx bounces "authenticated" user back → /dashboard
       │
     ♻️ INFINITE LOOP (plus client-logs rate-limit floods and
        MaxListenersExceededWarning on the dev-server Gzip from the storm)
```

**Root cause**: The resolver *warns* "Stale refresh_token JTI with valid session_id; allowing rotation" yet the subsequent `jtiMatchesSession` check **rejects** the same case — the code contradicts its own log. The M6 hardening made JTI matching unconditional (to close the stolen-cookies replay window), which broke the legitimate stale-cookie-after-parallel-rotation scenario: one tab's refresh rotates `session.payload.refreshTokenJti`, leaving the other tab's `refresh_token` cookie permanently stale while its `session_id` stays valid.

### Fix direction

- **Primary**: In `validateRefreshTokenJti`, when the session resolved via `session_id` and the `refresh_token` JWT *verifies* (same user, valid signature, `type: "refresh"`) but has a stale JTI, honor the "allowing rotation" contract — allow rotation and let `rotateTokensAndSession` write the fresh JTI. This converges both racing tabs onto a valid token pair instead of returning `null` forever. Strict JTI equality still applies on the non-`session_id` path (M6 replay protection).
- **Defense-in-depth**: keep the errorLink SSR/`/login` guards (no refresh-or-redirect while server-rendering or already on the login page) so a failed refresh can never bounce recursively.

## Fix Strategy

### Primary Fix: Update `getServerUserContext()` to Use Available Cookies

Change the server-side auth check to validate using `session_id` + `refresh_token` cookies (which are actually set as httpOnly cookies), instead of requiring an `access_token` cookie that doesn't exist.

**Updated flow:**

```
/dashboard (Server SSR)
  └─ getServerUserContext() reads cookies:
     ├─ session_id ✅ → validate session → get userId
     └─ refresh_token ✅ → fallback: verify JWT + match session → get userId
  └─ Returns: { userId, context } ✅ → renders dashboard
```

This aligns server-side auth with the reality of what cookies are available.

### Secondary Fixes

1. **Add `app/(auth)/layout.tsx`**: Server-side auth guard on login that redirects authenticated users to `/dashboard`, eliminating the client-side redirect flash.

2. **Fix `app/page.tsx`**: Smart redirect based on auth state instead of unconditionally redirecting to `/login`.

## Security Considerations

### Why `access_token` is NOT a Cookie (Design Decision)

The `access_token` is intentionally kept in React memory only to mitigate XSS attacks:
- If an attacker executes JavaScript via XSS, they **cannot** read httpOnly cookies
- The access token in memory is lost on page reload (by design)
- The `refreshToken` mutation (which **does** use httpOnly cookies) can silently restore auth

This design is sound — the fix preserves it by making the server-side auth check use the httpOnly cookies that exist, rather than requiring a cookie that was deliberately excluded.

### `sameSite: "strict"` Consideration

Auth cookies use `sameSite: "strict"`, which blocks cookies on cross-site navigations. For a same-site app this is generally fine, but `"lax"` would be more forgiving for external redirects back to the app. This is a separate security decision and not part of the current fix.

## Addendum — Preview-Gateway Trailing-Slash Loop (bare `/dashboard`)

### Symptom

Logging in through the z.ai preview gateway
(`preview-chat-*.space-z.ai`) lands the browser on
`ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS` ("redirected you too many times"). Direct
`localhost:3000` access is unaffected — the same login succeeds and lands
on the role dashboard.

### Root Cause

The gateway canonicalizes **exactly the bare path `/dashboard`** to a
trailing slash (verified: `301 /dashboard → /dashboard/`; every other app
path — `/login`, `/teacher/dashboard`, even nonexistent paths — passes
through untouched). Next.js (default `trailingSlash: false`) answers
`308 /dashboard/ → /dashboard`. A browser sent to bare `/dashboard`
therefore ping-pongs between the two forever:

```text
browser → GET /dashboard    → gateway 301 → /dashboard/
browser → GET /dashboard/   → Next 308    → /dashboard
browser → GET /dashboard    → gateway 301 → /dashboard/   … ∞
```

The app compounded this by using bare `/dashboard` as the universal
browser-facing redirect target: the login-form fallback, the `(auth)`
authenticated bounce, the sidebar dashboard item (all roles), the app-bar
wordmark, the profile "back" button, the server guards' role-mismatch
fallback, and the dispatcher's own anonymous
`/login?redirect=/dashboard` param (which fed the login form's push back
into the trap).

### Fix — "never navigate the browser to bare `/dashboard`"

New helper `frontend/lib/auth/roleDashboardRoute.ts`:

- `roleDashboardPath(role)` — role → role-specific dashboard route
  (mirrors the server dispatcher's `ROLE_DASHBOARD_ROUTE`; accepts both
  backend lowercase values and codegen capitalized values via
  lower-case normalization; unknown/null falls back to the student
  dashboard, same least-privilege precedent as `getNavItemsForRole`).
- `resolvePostAuthTarget(redirectParam, role)` — explicit safe
  `?redirect=` param wins **unless it is bare `/dashboard`** (legacy
  bookmarks / old errorLink URLs), else the role dashboard.

Call-site changes (all previously targeted bare `/dashboard`):

| Call site | Change |
|-----------|--------|
| `app/(auth)/login/LoginForm.tsx` | pushes only an explicit safe non-`/dashboard` param; no-param case defers to the layout's role-aware bounce |
| `app/(auth)/layout.tsx` | authenticated bounce → `resolvePostAuthTarget(param, user?.role)` |
| `frontend/views/dashboard/navItems.ts` | each role's dashboard item points at its own role route |
| `frontend/views/dashboard/DashboardSidebar.tsx` | exact-match active highlighting (prefix special-case obsolete) |
| `frontend/views/dashboard/DashboardAppBar.tsx` | wordmark href → role dashboard |
| `frontend/views/dashboard/profile/ProfileView.tsx` | "back to dashboard" → role dashboard |
| `frontend/lib/auth/requireRoleForPage.ts` | role-mismatch fallback → `roleDashboardPath(ctx.role)` |
| `frontend/lib/auth/withPageAuth.ts` | same |
| `app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx` | anonymous branch → bare `/login` (stops producing the poisoned param) |

The `/dashboard` dispatcher route itself stays online — it remains a
valid server-side deep-link entry point on direct deployments; it is just
never used as a browser navigation target from inside the app.

Contract tests: `frontend/lib/auth/roleDashboardRoute.test.ts` (mapping,
lowercase/capitalized parity, bare-`/dashboard` rejection, open-redirect
guard precedence).
