/**
 * usePurchaseSubscription — the checkout-initiation flow behind the
 * purchase confirm dialog, extracted from `PlansCatalogContainer` (the
 * flat view-file convention).
 *
 * Owns the `useMutation(purchaseSubscriptionMutationDocument)` wiring
 * carrying the purchase attempt's idempotency key via the Apollo context
 * header `x-idempotency-key` — the key is minted once per attempt into a
 * `useRef` and regenerated ONLY after a successful purchase (failed
 * submits and dialog cancels keep the same key so the server-side replay
 * dedupe stays effective), and it never rides the input DTO.
 *
 * The input whitelist carries exactly one client-owned field: the catalog
 * plan id (`input.planId`). Amount, currency, and billing data derive
 * server-side from the plan row — nothing else leaves the client.
 *
 * Outcome routing (`PlanPurchaseOutcome`):
 *  - `redirected` — the gateway returned a hosted `checkoutUrl`; the
 *    browser navigates via `globalThis.window.location.href` (the
 *    auth-recovery hard-redirect idiom — an external host, so the SPA
 *    router is not involved) and the hook returns without further UI work.
 *  - `completed` — the provider activated instantly with NO hosted
 *    checkout (`checkoutUrl: null`, the built-in mock among them); the
 *    caller shows the activated-state notice and keeps the dialog closed.
 *  - `failed` — a transport-shaped rejection; the caller surfaces the
 *    mapped copy and reopens the dialog for a retry (same key).
