 * one hop faster, and immune to the preview-gateway trailing-slash loop
 * (gateway 301s `/dashboard` → `/dashboard/`, Next.js 308s it back — see
 * `frontend/lib/auth/roleDashboardRoute.ts`).
 *
 * Routes that don't have a real page yet resolve to the `app/(dashboard)/[feature]/page.tsx`
 * catch-all, which renders the `ComingSoonView`. Real routes (Dashboard,
 * Profile) take precedence over the catch-all per Next.js route resolution.
