/**
 * useAdminStudentsDirectory — state and query wiring for
 * `AdminStudentsDirectoryContainer` (the admin student directory surface).
 *
 * Owns the `adminStudents` query (cache-and-network so refetches keep the
 * current rows visible while the fresh page streams in) and the feedback
 * snackbar shared by the copy-email quick action and the export flow
 * (success / warning / error lanes), composing the extracted cohesive
 * blocks that live beside it in this folder:
 *  - `useStudentsDirectoryFilters` — the filter/search/pagination draft
 *    state (each setter resetting the page to the first page),
 *  - `useStudentsUrlSync` — the SHAREABLE-URL mirror of the APPLIED state
 *    (the query string seeds the initial state on mount via the filters
 *    hook's fail-closed parse and is written back through `router.replace`
 *    whenever the applied state settles, so a filtered view can be copied,
 *    bookmarked, or reloaded — directory-url-state.ts owns the pure
 *    contract),
 *  - `useStudentsExportAll` — the server-side EXPORT-ALL flow (the
 *    dedicated export document executed with the SAME normalized filter
 *    state the listing uses; the backend caps the dump and reports
 *    `truncated` honestly).
 *
 * This directory is READ-ONLY — no mutations exist on this surface. The
 * hook returns plain state — no JSX. Errors surface through the same
 * `hasError` / `firstErrorCode` pair the users directory renders as an
 * alert with a retry action.
