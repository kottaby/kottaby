/**
 * ApproveWithdrawalDialog — the settlement confirm dialog of the withdrawal
 * payout queue (`/admin/finances`): approve (settle → completed) for ONE
 * pending withdrawal. Confirm/cancel only — NO reason field (an approval is
 * not reason-bearing; the rejection dialog owns the mandatory reason).
 *
 * Structural sibling of the session-governance dialog family: the gated
 * `Dialog` shell (backdrop click and Escape are IGNORED while the mutation
 * is pending — the cancel Button is separately disabled), the form element
 * hosted on the paper, and `React.SubmitEvent` discipline — carried by the
 * shared {@link GovernanceFormDialog} / {@link GovernanceDialogActions}
 * atoms.
 *
 * The mutation lives in the parent panel's `useApproveWithdrawal` seam —
 * this dialog is presentational and receives the trigger + in-flight flag.
 *
 * MUI v9 discipline: `sx`-only styling, theme-palette colors, ≥44px touch
 * targets, keyboard-focusable dialog (`aria-labelledby`).
