/**
 * Admin financial-auditing GraphQL documents — the payments audit read-back,
 * the teacher-wallet inspector and the withdrawal settlement / wallet
 * adjustment mutations.
 *
 * Per `frontend/graphql/sharedDocuments/AGENTS.md`:
 *  - Documents use `gql` + `TypedDocumentNode` (codegen types only).
 *  - `id` is selected FIRST in every row selection so Apollo normalizes the
 *    cache entries (`AdminStudentPayment` rows, `TeacherTransaction` rows);
 *    the id-less wrapper types (`AdminStudentPaymentPage`,
 *    `AdminTeacherWallet`, `AdminWithdrawalQueueRow`,
 *    `AdminWithdrawalQueuePage`) are embedded value types
 *    (`keyFields: false` in `frontend/providers/apollo/apolloCache.ts`) and
 *    never need an `id`.
 *  - Consumed in views via `useQuery`/`useMutation` from
 *    `@apollo/client/react` — NO `useLazyQuery`.
 *  - Variables are typed, never string-interpolated.
 *  - Money amounts arrive as exact decimal strings — never numeric.
