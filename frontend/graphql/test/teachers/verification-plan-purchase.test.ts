/**
 * `purchaseVerificationPlan` mutation — wire-boundary integration suite.
 *
 * Runs over the REAL boundary: `setupTestServerLifecycle` boots the Next dev
 * server on the shared TEST_PORT (3066) and every call goes through Apollo
 * Client v4 + the shared error helpers (`expectMutationError`) exactly like
 * `frontend/graphql/test/teachers/applicant-profile.test.ts` (the pattern
 * source for the register/login + Bearer-header harness in this file).
 *
 * Boundary purity (frontend/graphql/test/AGENTS.md rule 10): this file
 * interacts with the application EXCLUSIVELY through the GraphQL API
 * (`testClient` + shared TypedDocumentNodes). Entity provisioning that has
 * no public GraphQL surface rides the sanctioned `test/helpers` seam —
 * never a direct `db`/drizzle import in the test file. The zero-write
 * invariant on denials is asserted in the SERVICE tier
 * (`backend/services/teachers/verification-purchase.service.test.ts`),
 * which owns the ledger-visibility tooling it needs.
 *
 * Denial matrix (the happy-path purchase is owned by the service suite
 * `backend/services/teachers/verification-purchase.service.test.ts` and the
 * J1 journey — deliberately NOT duplicated here, so this suite has no
 * dependency on a purchasable-catalog happy path):
 *  - anonymous (no Bearer) → UNAUTHORIZED — the `authenticated` authScope
 *    denies before the resolver (401 channel, never FORBIDDEN).
 *  - authenticated STUDENT (non-applicant) with a VALID idempotency key →
 *    APPLICANT_NOT_FOUND — the applicant eligibility gate lives at the
 *    SERVICE level (scope-composition rule: the surface declares only
 *    `{ authenticated: true }`), so the wire proof is the propagated
 *    extensions.code of the in-transaction guard.
 *  - teacher applicant (public registration provisions the pending
 *    `applicants` row) WITHOUT a key → VALIDATION — the pre-DB key guard
 *    rejects the absent header before any database work.
 *
 * Documents: shared TypedDocumentNodes only —
 * `purchaseVerificationPlanMutationDocument`
 * (`sharedDocuments/billing/verification-purchase.documents.ts`) for the
 * mutation and `planCatalogQueryDocument` for the catalog probe. No local
 * `parse`d strings, no raw queries (AGENTS.md rule 3).
 *
 * Idempotency key transport:
 *  - The key rides the per-request `x-idempotency-key` header exactly as
 *    `gqlContextFactory` captures it (propagation-only; raw verbatim value,
 *    `null` when absent). The keyless probe simply omits the header.
 *
 * Data lifecycle (HYGIENE — mirrors the sibling suites):
 *  - Every user this suite creates is tracked by id and deleted in a
 *    describe-scoped `afterAll` via the shared `deleteUsersByIds` helper
 *    (RESTRICT-gated references first, then the users; child rows cascade).
 *  - The verification plan is resolved by the purchase flow SERVER-side
 *    (canonical title constant) BEFORE the applicant gate, so the student
 *    probe needs an ACTIVE canonical catalog member to reach the mandated
 *    APPLICANT_NOT_FOUND. The member is provisioned CONDITIONALLY over the
 *    GraphQL boundary (an authenticated catalog probe in `beforeAll`):
 *    seeded catalogs (this CI tier seeds before the suite runs) already
 *    carry it and the suite provisions nothing; only a catalog WITHOUT the
 *    canonical member triggers the sanctioned
 *    `insertVerificationPlanRow` seam. The purchase service REJECTS an
 *    ambiguous catalog (multiple active rows sharing the canonical title),
 *    so a blind insert would flip every purchase into a conflict — the
 *    conditional is load-bearing. The fixture row (when one was created)
 *    is deleted by explicit id in the same `afterAll` — never a title
 *    sweep.
